# ISPolitical Documentation
Their website is fine, I just prefer markdown and classical documentation.

[![Build & Deploy Pages](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/isp-docs/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/isp-docs/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment) [![Run Rust Run! ðŸ¦€ðŸ’¨](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/isp-docs/actions/workflows/rusty_yeets.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/isp-docs/actions/workflows/rusty_yeets.yml)

There is a GitHub action which crawls their sitemap and saves the content to the `raw` directory. It then generates `all_docs.md` because why not?

After crawling & capturing, it generates a documentation site at https://ispdocs.henselforcongress.com/
