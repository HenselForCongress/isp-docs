# ISPolitical Documentation
Their website is fine, I just prefer markdown and classical documentation.

There is a GitHub action which crawls their sitemap and saves the content to the `raw` directory. It then generates `all_docs.md` because why not?

After crawling & capturing, it generates a documentation site at https://ispdocs.henselforcongress.com/
