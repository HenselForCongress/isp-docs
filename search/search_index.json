Here are a few examples to help demonstrate situations that are most common.</p> <p>Example 1: A donor gives $800 in aggregate outside of the 90-day reporting period. They then donate $500 in the 90-day reporting period. This $500 amount would not pull because it\u2019s under the $1,000 aggregate amount for the 90-day reporting period.</p> <p>Example 2: A donor gave $500 in the 90-day reporting period. They then give another $600 in the same 90-day reporting period. This donor now aggregates to $1,000 or more in the 90-day reporting period and will need to be reported on a 497.</p> <p>Example 3: A donor gives $1,100 in the 90-day reporting period. This is reported on a 497. The donor then gives another $700 in the 90-day reporting period.

If your amendment needs a date different than the original, you\u2019ll need a backdoor password.</p> <p>If the original report was filed by paper and the amendment will be filed electronically, the amended report should be filed as an original and the FEC will be able to link the two.</p> <p>If you\u2019re trying to amend a prior report to be an amendment, generate the report with the Amended box checked and the Report Period set to Termination. The FEC doesn\u2019t allow both the Amended and Termination boxes to be checked, but it\u2019s more important that the report be marked as Termination rather than Amendment. When you generate the report like this, the Amended box will not be checked on the cover page. This is expected and there\u2019s nothing that can be done about this.</p> <p>Help File Home | Full Index | Contact Support</p> <p>\u21d1 FEC Campaign, Party, &amp; PAC Filing FAQ and Resources \u00ab About FEC Conduit (Earmark) Memos Alabama Campaign, Party, &amp; PAC Filing FAQ and Resources \u00bb</p>"},{"location":"beta-compliance-reports/","title":"Beta Compliance Reports","text":""},{"location":"beta-compliance-reports/#why-am-i-able-to-see-a-beta-compliance-report","title":"Why am I able to see a BETA Compliance Report?","text":"<p>Compliance reports sometimes require a quick bug fix or update to the report.

This will save time and trouble when it comes to reporting this information. Typically, Credit Card expenses are considered a type of debt and not a regular expense. However, this may vary per your filing agency.</p> <p>The simplest way for both data entry and for reporting is to look at each individual month as its own separate debt, or Accrued Expense.\u00a0</p> <p>There are a handful of pointers to keep in mind when it comes to credit card accrued expenses.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Treat each month that is not paid off in full as a new accrued expense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Payments are standard payments on accrued expenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each purchase that makes up the total amount accrued that month should be entered as a split on the accrued expense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interest charges are just like any other split, but to the credit card company. They will appear on the statement they showed up on and should be reported.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here\u2019s an example and how all this would apply.</p> <p>If you accrue a $1000 balance in credit card bills in April and made a $100 payment, that would reduce the April Accrued Expense total down to $900. Then, if another $1000 in credit card bills is accrued in May, you would have two accrued expenses: April\u2019s balance would be $900 and May\u2019s would be $1000. If you paid $200 more off in May, you could apply that payment to one credit card accrued expense or split between both. How, or if it is split, does not matter overall as long as the total payments are correct.</p> <p>Using the example above, let\u2019s include interest charges. For May, you accrued a $90 interest charge and this shows on your May statement. Given that the $1000 accrued in May includes the $90 interest charge, you would enter the splits as usual, including a $90 split for the interest charge, just as if it was any other expense on the card.</p> <p>Help File Home | Full Index | Contact Support</p> <p>\u21d1 About Balances \u00ab How Do I Generate Reports of Pledges &amp; Targets?

Below are some common areas that sometimes can result in report issues and what needs to be done to ensure the data appears on the report correctly.</p> <p>Business Types:\u00a0We suggest using the Set Business Type AI option to cover your bases. For records with LLC, Inc. or LLP in the title but no Business Type has been set, AI will automatically set this for you. Again, this has a significant benefit for NY reporting.</p> <p>When it comes to entity types, New York has entities like PLLCs and PLLPs. They are reported the same as LLCs and LLPs, respectively, so there will be no difference in data entry.</p> <p>Monetary Contributions from LLCs, Partnerships, or LLPs:\u00a0These transaction types need to report their ownership or partnership shares. This is done by adding Splits to each partner or owner based on the percentage of partnership or ownership. Be sure to create new records for the partners and attribute the Splits to those records rather than to the LLP or LLC and leaving a note.</p> <p>Please note if the data entry is correct, you\u2019ll see these appear on Schedule O (Partners/Subcontractors) of the report.</p> <p>Opening E-Filings</p> <p>We generally discourage opening e-files in other programs because it can cause errors when trying to file the report. However, if you do need to open the e-file, do so in Notepad or Notepad++. Do not open these files in Excel (or a similar app), as doing so will delete many of the required columns.</p> <p>Reimbursements:\u00a0These need to be made to the reimbursee with Reporting Code REIMB. The items being reimbursed should then be added as Splits and all of them should have their own Reporting Codes</p> <p>Transaction Methods:\u00a0Be sure to select a transaction method for any monetary transactions, as required by the NYBOE. If you are unsure or if none of the transaction methods apply, include an explanation why in your compliance note.</p> <p>Transaction Numbers: New York requires that all transactions made through Check must have a check number reported.

In this help file, we want to share some of the basics when it comes to accounting both here in ISP and beyond.</p> <p>First, while there are plenty of different transaction types, the most commonly used transactions are Monetary Contributions and Expenses, and each transaction will have a cash impact.</p> <p>For example, Monetary Contributions and Other Income transactions increase cash, while Expenses decrease cash.</p> <p>There are also some transactions, such as Inkind Contributions, that have no impact on cash. The reason is they are considered a gift of something rather than money.</p> <p>Sometime you want to enter the exact opposite of a transaction, such as a reversed Monetary Contribution. A reversed Monetary Contribution is a lot like an expense, as its purpose is to decrease to cash. These are created by checking the Is Reversal box at the top of the transaction details.</p> <p>So if reversed contributions reduce cash and so do expenses, what\u2019s the difference? It is a subtle one and mostly has to do with properly understanding, as well as reporting, your finances.</p> <p>With a campaign, or a business, you have your income and you have your expenses. A reversed contribution is a decrease in income rather than an expense. The most common situation would be a bounced check.</p> <p>Best Practices</p> <p>When adding contributions to the system prior to batching them into deposits, it helps to add them to the Undeposited area, then batch them according to when they were deposited into your bank account, as opposed to adding each transaction to the Register and batching them after the fact. This also will allow for a smoother reconciliation process.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a useful practice to add transactions to the database as soon as you can. This allows the AI feature to warn you of any potential issues with your transactions you may have missed when adding them. When it comes to reporting, the last thing you\u2019ll want to deal with are issues on a deadline.</p> <p>Bookkeeping</p> <p>Bookkeeping is essentially a way of recognizing there\u2019s an accounting mistake somewhere but you don\u2019t have the time to figure out exactly what so in the meantime, in order to temporarily get totals correct, you\u2019ll enter a correcting transaction instead.</p> <p>Please note we don\u2019t recommend this but we understand sometimes it\u2019s necessary.</p> <p>Once you have filed your report or handled any other tasks that required the Bookkeeping transaction, be sure to go back and determine the cause of the discrepancy, then remove the Bookkeeping transaction.</p> <p>Cash vs. Net Worth</p> <p>You may see these two terms in the system: Cash on Hand and Net Worth. While they have some similarities in specifics, the biggest difference between the two is that Cash on Hand is the actual amount of money you have in the bank, and Net Worth is the cash you have MINUS any outstanding debt you may have, such as loans or accrued expenses.</p> <p>You can generate a report of Cash vs Net Worth on the Compliance Tools page under the Reporting tab.</p> <p>Help File Home | Full Index | Contact Support</p> <p>\u21d1 How Can I Use ISP in My Favor? \u00ab What Are ISP Best Practices?

Below are some suggested best practices to help with that.</p> <p>Unlimited Users: Take Advantage of It:\u00a0ISP provides unlimited user access. It\u2019s a good practice to take advantage of this feature and provide access to all team members who require it. This ensures everyone has access to the same information and reduces the risk of errors. It also allows you to give different users different levels of access and, if something goes wrong, know exactly who is responsible.</p> <p>Use 2FA:\u00a0Using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounting software. It ensures that only authorized users have access to the accounting records.</p> <p>Enter Data As It Happened: Our core rule when it comes to how to create transactions in ISP is to enter the information as it happened in real time, such as using the real time date of a transaction or deposit. This will help ensure both your data and Compliance reports are accurate.</p> <p>Use Budget Categories for Both Receipts and Disbursements:\u00a0Using budget categories for receipts and disbursements helps with tracking the expenses and revenue of your campaign, party, or PAC. This, in turn, helps in creating a budget plan and analyzing the performance of the organization.</p> <p>Make Deposit Batches Frequently:\u00a0It\u2019s a good practice to make deposit batches frequently rather than delaying it for an extended period. This ensures the accounting records are up to date and any discrepancies or errors can be identified early on.</p> <p>Perform Bank Reconciliations:\u00a0Bank reconciliations are a crucial part of accounting properly. Doing so ensures your records in ISP match with the transactions reported by the bank. This process allows you to be sure the records are accurate and complete. Failing to do so means that you could be filing incorrect campaign finance statements.</p> <p>Use One of Our Partners That Specializes in Politics for Accepting Donations:\u00a0Using a partner that specializes in politics for accepting donations ensures the donations are compliant with the relevant laws and regulations. This reduces the risk of any legal issues.</p> <p>Use AI to Import from Partners:\u00a0Using AI to import transactions from partners reduces the manual effort required to enter the data. This assures you the records are accurate and complete.</p> <p>Use AI to Check for Over the Limit Transactions and Other Issues:\u00a0Using AI to check for over the limit transactions and other issues helps in identifying any discrepancies or errors early on. This makes sure the necessary changes can be made before any legal issues arise.</p> <p>Use AI to Get Missing Occupations and Employers:\u00a0Using AI to get missing occupations and employers saves time and reduces the manual effort required to enter the data. It helps in keeping the accounting records accurate and up to date.</p> <p>Use AI to Combine Duplicate Entities:\u00a0Using AI to combine duplicate entities saves time and reduces the risk of errors. It helps in keeping the accounting records accurate and up to date and ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally accept donations in excess of limits.</p> <p>Send Scheduled Reports to Candidate, Chair, and Other Key Personnel Who May Not be Daily ISP Users:\u00a0Sending scheduled reports to key personnel who may not be daily ISP users ensures that everyone is aware of the financial status of the organization. This helps in making informed decisions and planning for the future.</p> <p>Generate Your Compliance Reports Early:\u00a0Generating compliance reports early helps in identifying any issues or discrepancies early on. This allows you to make the necessary changes before the report is submitted.</p> <p>Use Dropbox Integration to Keep Legally Required Backup Right with the Associated Transaction:\u00a0Using Dropbox integration to keep legally required backups ensures the records are stored securely and can be accessed easily when required. This helps in complying with the relevant laws and regulations.</p> <p>Ask Support for Help:\u00a0Asking for support when required assures you that any issues or queries are resolved quickly.

When paid, it impacts your cash balance as an accrued expense payment. Accrued expenses are a type of debt. Accrued Income No Yes Accrued Income is when incoming money is expected but not yet received. For example, an invoice is sent and the other entity agrees to pay the invoice but hasn\u2019t yet. When the money is received, the payment is created as an Accrued Income Payment transaction. Allocation Transfer Yes Yes This is a transfer between associated State and Federal committees. It assists with handling federal regulations related to allocating contributions and expenses between State and Federal funds. Use Internal Transfers for transfers between different accounts of the same filer. Enforceable Pledge No No Contributions that have been pledged to be given, but have not yet been realized. Expense Yes Yes Expenses are the cost required for something/money spent on something for your campaign or committee. In-Kind Contribution No No Transactions that are considered a gift of something rather than money. Internal Transfer No No Internal Transfers allow you to move funds between accounts. They are for non-reportable transfers or, in other words, transfers between accounts under the same filer. Use Allocation Transfers for transfers between different filer committees. Loan Made Yes Yes Money that is given that is intended to be repaid. Unlike an accrued expense, a loan involves an actual transfer of money.

At more abstract levels, when designing new functionality from scratch, a developer will use the vague concept of \u2018user\u2019 to map out the user interface. Since the developer doesn\u2019t know his clients, doesn\u2019t know their names, what else does he/she have to go by? They use a vague concept.

Many companies don\u2019t see any issue with designing software for users. It gets the job done. The software performs the task required. But here\u2019s the thing; it\u2019s software for a user, not a person. And software made for a user tends to suck. It sucks because a user is not a person.</p> <p>A user is a vague concept. It\u2019s bland, inhuman, humdrum, robotic, inorganic, and lifeless. A user performs a task. A user has no life, nothing else they\u2019d rather do, nothing else they must do. A user has no other priorities than using the software, completing individual tasks as conceived of in the imagination of a developer.</p> <p>Think of it this way, a developer writes code for one little piece of the entire system at a time. If they write this code for a user, they will consider only how to accomplish it. Because a user is inanimate, they only care that something can get done. They don\u2019t care how it gets done. And that is a big, big deal. Because a user won\u2019t complain. A user won\u2019t throw a computer out a window when the user has to click a completely useless button 500 times. A user won\u2019t smile when something goes right. A user won\u2019t dole out any social consequences (no frowns, no bad reviews, no crossed arms, no frustrated sighs, no angry remarks) or rewards (no smiles, no hugs, no \u2018thank you\u2019s, no excellent reviews, no referrals, and etc.).</p> <p>So there\u2019s no social pressure on the developer to go the extra mile, to reduce friction, to make sure the task gets completed in the most efficient and pleasant way possible. When a developer builds software for a user, you get software built for a user. Humans rarely like this kind of software.</p> <p>Humans hate this kind of software precisely because it\u2019s not designed for them. It\u2019s a subtle point with staggering consequences. A person simply is not a user. You are vibrant, have feelings, are guided by them. You get impatient. You smile. You frown. You have a million ways of letting people know whether you\u2019re happy or angry. A good support and development staff will remember these signals and get better at interpreting them over time.
