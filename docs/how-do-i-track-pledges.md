 How Do I Track Pledges?
==========

Sometimes a donor makes a promise to contribute to the campaign in the future. In that situation, you can use the Pledge option to track that promised donation. These can be tracked in two different places, either on the Dashboard or within the entity’s record itself.

### From the Dashboard ###

On the Dashboard is a Pledge Aging section. Here you’ll see totals of any remaining outstanding donation pledges grouped by date ranges. To the right of each date range is the hot dog menu. Using this you can choose to export the outstanding pledge data to a spreadsheet, call sheets, or view the records that have outstanding pledges.

If you see a date and time showing in the Pledge Aging section, this indicates the last time the report was updated. Click the Update option to bring the data current. If you don’t see a date and time, the report is current.

### From within the record ###

In any given record is a section called Pledges & Targets. In there you’ll see the following columns: Fulfilled Amount and Outstanding.

* **Fulfilled Amount:** This lets you know how much towards the full pledge amount has already been donated.
* **Outstanding:** If there is a remaining balance of the pledge, this amount will show in the Outstanding column.

In order to add donations towards the campaign pledge amount, click the date of the pledge and when the window appears, enter in a Fulfilled Amount or click the Is Written Off option if the pledge has been forgiven or written off.
