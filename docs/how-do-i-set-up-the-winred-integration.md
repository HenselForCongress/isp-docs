 How Do I Set up the WinRed Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

WinRed integrates directly with ISP, allowing you to have the information from your WinRed account transfer directly into your ISP account.

1. Under the Integrations tab, select Add/Remove

2. Locate the WinRed integration in the Available section

3. Click the integration to install it

After you have completed the setup process on ISP’s side, head over to your WinRed account.

1. Log in to your WinRed account at portal.winred.com  
2. Navigate to Utilities, then select the Integrations tab  
3. Click ISP  
4. Enter your Integration name, any notes, your ISP account name, and toggle the Integration Status to On. Click Save.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a WinRed organization record in the account with WinRed’s details.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from WinRed via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, WinRed will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

You can control how your transactions come into ISP through the Auto-Import settings on the [ai@ISP page](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-ai-isp/).

Linking a Donation Page  

----------

With WinRed, you can also link a donation page for easy access from within ISP.

To link a donation page, navigate to the Integrations tab, click the WinRed option. Below the integration status is a Donation Page section. This allows you to link your WinRed donation page. Enter a Name for the Donation Page and the URL address. If you want to have multiple Donation Page options, you can add more than one.

Once the Donation Page has been added and your donation page linked, you’ll be able to add donations directly through ISP. This option will be found in two locations: Individual Search Results and Add Transaction.

In Individual Search Results, after a search is performed and the results appear, click the hot dog menu and select Enter Credit Card: WinRed Individual Record Details: When in the record, click the Add button at the bottom of the screen and select Enter Credit Card.

When the link opens, the entity’s basic contact info will auto-populate, and you’ll see fields to enter in donation information. The donation will be processed by Winred and come into ISP via the regular integration method.
