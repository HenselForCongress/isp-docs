The Washington Form C4 – Ballot Measure Report is to report contributions and expenditures by a committee supporting or opposing a ballot measure. Aggregation is totaled per Calendar Year. The Current Election selection determines the election Year. If you select Non-Election, we use the year in the To Date.
