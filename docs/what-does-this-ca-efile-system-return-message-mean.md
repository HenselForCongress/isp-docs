 What Does This CA Efile System Return Message Mean?
==========

Applies To: California

After you efile a CA report from ISP, you may get a system return message that is confusing.

Here’s what these messages could mean:

1) Status: the job failed to process  
This message is likely because you attempted to file the report to local instead of filing to the state. Regenerate your report and select Efile Report instead of Efile Report to Local
