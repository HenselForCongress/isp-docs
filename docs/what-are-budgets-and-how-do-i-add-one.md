 What Are Budgets and How Do I Add One?
==========

In ISP, you can use Budgets to track your expenses or the various income sources.

To add a Budget to your database, navigate to Accounting tab, then to Budgets. On the resulting screen click the Add Budget button at the bottom of the screen to add a new one. 

In the window that appears, add a Name for the Budget, select which Filer this particular budget will be tracking, and the Date range fields to specify a certain time period. Please note these date fields are required.

You also have a slider for Cash Basis or Net Worth Basis.

The drop down menu for Inkinds allows you to Exclude this non-monetary transaction, or you can include them in Receipts or both Receipts & Disbursements.

Finally, click Add Budget to create the budget in your database or click Add & New to create that budget and start a new one.

Once you’ve added the Budget, you’ll see it on the Budgets screen along with others you may have created. To the right of each budget is a See Report button. Clicking this displays the breakdown of the budget by Budgeted Amount, Actual Amount, then the percentage.

There is also a Manage button. This will allow you to manage the details of the Budget and other Budget Details.

At the bottom of the main Budgets screen is an option to print the Budget details to a PDF.

**Uncategorized Transactions**
----------

On your budget, you may have a line labeled Uncategorized. These are transactions associated with a budget category that has not been added to your budget.

To figure out which budget category or categories it is, go to the Reports tab, then to Financial, and run a Budget Category report. Look for any budget categories that are not included in your budget.
