 What Is the Threshold to Register a FEC Committee?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Committee registration must take place with the FEC the moment it reaches the $5000 threshold of money raised or spent. Per the FEC registration guidelines in the [FEC Campaign Guide](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/candgui.pdf):

* The individual and/or persons he or she has authorized to conduct campaign activity receive over $5,000 in contributions or make over $5,000 in expenditures; or
* The individual fails to disavow unauthorized campaign activity by writing a letter to the FEC within 30 days after being notified by the agency that another person or group has received contributions or made expenditures of more than $5,000 on the individual’s behalf. 100.3(a)(1)-(3) and 102.13(a)(2).

The necessary forms, [FEC Form 1](https://ispolitical.com/About-the-FEC-Form-1-Report/) and [FEC Form 2](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-the-form-2-and-when-do-i-file-it/), are found on the [FEC website](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/forms/).

After the committee has been registered with the FEC, reports must be filed no matter how much is raised or spent until the committee has been terminated.
