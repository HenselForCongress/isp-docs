 How Do I Create ActBlue Conduit Transaction Deposit After an Import?
==========

One of the many ways transactions can be received and entered into the ISP system is through the [ActBlue integration](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-an-actblue-integration/). After they have been imported into the system, you have the option of recording the ActBlue conduit (earmark) deposit separate from the rest of the undeposited transactions.

How do I record an ActBlue deposit?
----------

On the Record Deposit screen, you’ll see a list of transactions ready to be deposited. If any of the contributions are part of an ActBlue conduit contribution, ensure the checkbox next to the transaction(s) in question is selected, then click the Record ActBlue Conduit Check button at the bottom of the screen. Note that the Record ActBlue Conduit Check option will not appear unless you have the ActBlue integration installed.

In the window that appears, you’ll have the option of setting the Check Date, Check Amount, Election, and Budget Category.

When determining the date to use for the whole, you should use the day the money was deposited into your account. 

When the transaction is saved, it will automatically populate the Transaction Tag field with Conduit – Conduit Check. This will not update the Tag field for Splits. If needed, that must be done separately.

Once you’ve added the applicable details, click the Add button.

This will direct you to the Edit Transaction screen where you’ll need to complete the main transaction details. You’ll notice, however, that most of the main details are filled in, and also the transactions you selected from the Deposit screen are showing as Splits.

After entering in all the details, choose either Save or Save & New at the bottom to finalize and add the ActBlue deposit to the system.
