How do I upload the PDP file to the state?
----------

To e-file with LA, you need to download the e-file, which already is formatted to PDP from ISP. LA requires PDP format and you will need to upload it into the state’s system. Log in to your [state account](https://eap.ethics.la.gov/LEADERS_PAC/Account/LogOn) to upload the PDF file.   

In Louisiana, visit their [PDP File Validation Tool](https://eap.ethics.la.gov/LeadersPDP/) and log in. After logging in, select the PDP file you were given from the state. Validate the PDP and once successfully passed validation, you will be able to E-file that report.
