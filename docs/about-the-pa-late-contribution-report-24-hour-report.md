**Philadelphia Specific Notes**

While Philadelphia does not capture Support/Oppose information, transactions that pull to this report need to follow our standard data entry for [Independent Expenditures](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-create-an-independent-expenditure/), which is based on Support/Oppose memos. This will not prevent you from filing the report with Philadelphia, as the report in ISP is designed to generate a compliant report using this data entry process.
