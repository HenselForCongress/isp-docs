 NH R and E (Candidate Version) Line by Line
==========

Applies To: New Hampshire

NOTES:

* NH efiling does not support the concept of splits or memos. Typically states want to see where the money originated/ended up, so we itemize splits as cash-impact transactions, and do not itemize the whole/parent transaction.
* NH efiling does not support the concept of negative transactions, so they are listed as positive receipts on the opposite schedule. (ie: reversed receipts as positive expenses; reversed expenses as positive receipts)
