 About the IA Form DR2 Report
==========

Applies To: Iowa

The IA Form DR2 is a disclosure report for contributions received, expenditures made, and indebtedness incurred. 

To file your report, you must download the generated file and import it as a .csv file to the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board’s Web Reporting System. Login into your [state account](https://webapp.iecdb.iowa.gov/Default.aspx) and file.

Please note that at this time, the WRS does not allow for importing Accrued Expense Payments or any transactions besides those reported on Schedules A and B. These transactions must be re-entered on the state’s system.
