 How Do I Set up Automated Drip Campaigns?
==========

Learn how to create automated Drip Campaigns in ISP software. Use Drip Campaigns in conjunction with saved Advanced Searches and AI to have Drip Campaigns run as an automated task. Our AI will automatically add contacts to a campaign or remove them based on your set rules in the saved search and a matching change to the contact’s record. This provides a lot of flexibility for your campaign.

In order to use this with Advanced Search, be sure you first have [Drip Campaigns set up](https://ispolitical.com/How-to-Create-Drip-Campaigns-Drip-Emails/). You can start by navigating to the Tools menu, then select Drip Campaigns. After you’ve added them or if you already have them created, navigate to the Advanced Search page under the Add/Search tab.

1. Add the criteria of the list you’d like to generate, then click Run Search.

2. After you get results, click on the Exports & Actions menu at the bottom of the screen and select Start Drip Campaign.

3. In the popup will appear, select the Drip Campaign you want to use and if you would like the AI to keep the campaign updated. You can choose to not have AI handle this, or you can choose from either of the following:

**Add Campaigns:** This option will add the Drip Campaign you select to records and run based on the criteria set previously.

**Add & Delete Campaigns:** This will add the campaign selected to the record that matches and delete any existing campaign on that record. In other words, it will replace anything already in place and start over if new criteria is matched.
