 How Do I Add a Form 3Z to the FEC Form 3 Report?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees

On the criteria page for your Compliance Report is an option for Form 3z. Any committees with relationships setup to the filer will be an option for including.  

If you do not see the Form 3Z option, make sure you enter the appropriate date range. The Form 3Z will not populate if the appropriate date range is not entered. If you still do not see the Form 3Z, double check there is a committee linked to your filing committee’s record as an Affiliate in the Relationships section. If there is no Affiliate selected, take the following steps from within your committee’s record:

1. Click on the green triangle next to Relationships
2. Enter the name of the affiliated committee in the Affiliated field
3. Select the relationship Affiliated
4. Click Add Relationship

All Political Committees linked to the Filer Committee via Relationship will be available options for Form 3Z. By default, all committees will be excluded. If you click View/Edit on the report criteria page, a pop-up will appear that will allow you to click on any committees shown. You can then toggle between Including or Excluding them.  

If you choose Include, you will then be able to enter the line totals to pull to the report. These fields are sticky fields, which means the numbers will remain until changed so you don’t have to do this each time you generate a report.  

According to the FEC, the principal campaign committee must also file a consolidated report (FEC Form 3Z), which summarizes information included in its own report and those filed by other authorized committees.  

Note that only authorized committees of the current campaign need to be included in the consolidated report.  

These consolidated reports must include: the candidate’s activity, reports submitted to the principal campaign committee by any other authorized committees, and the principal campaign committee’s own activity.

Committee Type Info
----------

**Authorized Committee:** A designated committee that takes in contributions and make expenditures on behalf of the campaign.

**Leadership PAC:** A political committee that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding a federal office. The committee is not an authorized committee of the candidate or office holder, and is not affiliated with an authorized committee of a candidate or office holder. Members of Congress and other political leaders often establish these non-connected committees to support candidates for federal and non-federal offices.
