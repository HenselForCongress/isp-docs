 How Do I Add Candidate and Committee Records Directly From the WA PDC?
==========

Applies To: Washington

In ISP you can add Committee and Candidate records to your database directly from the WA PDC site when using the Search option at the top of the screen. The imported information will include critical data, such as address, ID number, and other financial information.

First, if you haven’t yet, enable the WA PDC Search feature by navigating to the System tab and then to Account Management. On the resulting screen, locate the Account Preferences section and toggle on the option to include the data in searches.

After this feature has been enabled, when searching for committee records not already in your database, you’ll see the name you were searching for and a message allowing you to import from WA PDC data.

Clicking this will automatically add the record to your database and any pertinent information required for filing and standard information purposes.

On the Organization search page under the Add/Search tab, you’ll also see an option to Exclude matches from WA PDC data. This will help you limit the results on your screen.
