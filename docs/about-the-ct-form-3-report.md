 About the CT Form 30 Report
==========

Applies To: Connecticut

The CT Form 30 is used to report Contributions. Connecticut’s E-File system requires you to upload your report via their system using a specific format. To get the e-file you need, generate the report in ISP and download it. Then upload that saved file to [Connecticut’s system](https://seec.ct.gov/eCrisHome/).

If you open the downloaded e-file, you might get a scary looking warning. Don’t worry about it – this is ok! The file is totally safe.
