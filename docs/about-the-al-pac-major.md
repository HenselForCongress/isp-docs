 About the AL PAC Major
==========

Applies To: Alabama

The AL PAC Major Report is used to report Major Contributions and Expenditures. When preparing a Major contribution report, use the first day after the previous periodic day as the first day of the report. After filing the report, use “Mark as Filed” so that major contributions are only reported once.

The filing period begins the first day after the prior periodic report. 

To file your report, an XML file is generated by ISP, then uploaded to your agency’s electronic filing system. Any amendments or corrections are typed into the web-based filing system; and cannot be uploaded. Log into your [state account](https://fcpa.alabamavotes.gov/CampaignFinance/UserLogin.aspx) to file your report.
