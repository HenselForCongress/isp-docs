 About the MT Form C7 Report
==========

Applies To: Montana

The MT Form C7 Report allows you to see if you have received any Contributions that are required to be filed with the state within 2 business days. You must file these Contributions with the state’s [Campaign Electronic Reporting System](https://cers-ext.mt.gov/CampaignTracker/dashboard;jsessionid=676098C9517E8E60DAE184BA71E61053).

However, CERS does not currently support reporting contributions through the upload function. You must re-enter the Qualifying Contributions manually to CERS.
