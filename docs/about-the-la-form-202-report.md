 About the LA Form 202 Report
==========

Applies To: Louisiana

The LA Form 202 Report is a form filed by committees that support or oppose one or more candidates and/or propositions and that are not candidate committees. All transactions must be reported, regardless of the amount. However, In-kind transactions at $25 or less are not required to be reported. 

How do I get transactions to the total on Special Transactions?
----------

**Line 23:** Ensure the entity is marked as an organization Political Committee.  
**Line 24:** Ensure the monetary contribution has the tag Tickets.  
**Line 25:** Ensure the monetary contribution has the tag Campaign Paraphernalia.  
**Line 26:** Ensure the expense has the tag Petty Cash.

How do I upload the PDP file to the state?
----------

To e-file with LA, you need to download the e-file, which already is formatted to PDP from ISP. LA requires PDP format and you will need to upload it into the state’s system. Log in to your [state account](https://eap.ethics.la.gov/LEADERS_PAC/Account/LogOn) to upload the PDP file. 

In Louisiana, visit their [PDP File Validation Tool](https://eap.ethics.la.gov/LeadersPDP/) and log in. After logging in, select the PDP file you were given from the state. Validate the PDP and once successfully passed validation, you will be able to E-file that report.
