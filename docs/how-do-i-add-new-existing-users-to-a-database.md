 How Do I Add New & Existing Users to a Database?
==========

User roles play an important part in not just what staff and volunteers have access to but can also be vital in protecting data integrity and security. Many user roles are available, and while some roles have the same permissions, each one will have its limitations.

### How do I add a new user? ###

In the System tab, select Users. On the resulting screen, you’ll see a list of all the users in your database. To add one, click the Add User button at the bottom of the screen.

A window will appear and require you to enter in Name and Email information.

It’s very important to remember that an incorrect email address will prevent the new user from being able to access the system. If the email address is incorrect, they will not receive the email containing their login information.

You’ll also have fields that determine which Account database you’d like to give the user access to, as well as the Role you’d like to assign them. If you work with multiple databases, you’ll see the full list of databases to choose from.

When selecting a Role, you can view the [permissions each user role carries](https://ispolitical.com/user-permissions-in-isp/). Some will have more access to database features and functionalities than others. 

Once you have completed the fields, click the Add User button. That individual will receive a welcome email containing their account and login information.

### How do I add an existing user to a database? ###

This is similar to the steps above, in that you would access this from the same location, under the System tab.

In the window that appears, you’ll notice two tabs: New ISP User and Existing User(s). The default will show the New ISP User option, but when adding an already existing user to a database, be sure to click the Existing User(s) tab.

Select the user’s name from the menu in the top field, then select the Account you’d like to give them access to and which Role you would like them to have. 

When ready, click Add User. The individual will receive an email stating they’ve been given access to the database you chose.

### How do I update an existing user in a database?   
 ###

Once a user has been added to a database, only that user can change their name and/or email address. Deleting the user with the old information and then adding the same user with updated information will not work.
