 Where Do I Get the Original CA Filing ID Number?
==========

Applies To: California

When filing an amendment in ISP, the system will ask you for the Original Filing ID. The Original Filing ID, also known as the Report ID, can be found in the following three places:

1. When your report is accepted, there is a number indicated in the response. It’s usually called a Filing ID. If you go to Previously Generated Reports and look at your filed reports, you can find the Filing ID there.
2. You can also find the Filing ID in an email from Netfile after your report was successfully filed.
3. The final place the Filing ID can be found is by using the public portal for your jurisdiction, searching for your committee name, and locating the report.
