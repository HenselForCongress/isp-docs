To file your report, an XML file is generated by ISP, then uploaded to your agency’s electronic filing system. Any amendments or corrections are typed into the web-based filing system; and cannot be uploaded.  Log into your [state account](https://fcpa.alabamavotes.gov/CampaignFinance/UserLogin.aspx) to file your report.
