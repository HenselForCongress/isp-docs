 How Do I Add Reimbursements to Personal Expenses for Oregon Compliance Reports?
==========

Applies To: Oregon

If you have a reimbursement on a personal expense, Oregon requires this to be reported in a specific way. Per the guide, there should be two transactions on the report to reflect the reimbursement.

1. Create the personal expense by adding an Accrued Expense with the Tag: Personal to the individual being reimbursed. For the specific expenses involved, add those as Splits.
2. Add an [Accrued Expense Payment](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-full-or-partial-payment-to-an-accrued-expense/) to the Accrued Expense you just created. 

A very important part of this process is adding the Tag: Personal to the original Accrued Expense. If this is not added, the reimbursement will not report correctly.
