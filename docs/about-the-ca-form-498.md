 About the CA Form 498
==========

Applies To: California

The CA Form 498 compliance report is used to report Late Payments Received that are $2,500 or more in aggregate to support (or oppose)  
 a single candidate (or committee) 90 days before an election.

If you are expecting a transaction to pull to this report, make sure there is a Support/Oppose Memo on the transaction. If there are multiple reports, they will generate in alphabetical order based on the S/O Memo.

How do I set up the Form 498 Report in ISPolitical?
----------

When generating a Form 498 in ISPolitical, navigate to the Reports tab, then Compliance. On the resulting criteria page, set up the following  
required fields:

**Filer:** Make sure the correct person/entity is selected (if you have more than one).  
**Compliance Report:** Select the CA Form 498 from the listed report types.  
**Current Election:** The report will use the Current Election field to determine the 90-day report period for the Payments Rec’d.  
**From/To Dates:** This sets the starting date and ending date for the Payments Rec’d.  
**Entity:** This is an optional field. If you know the name of the Support/Oppose entity, you can begin typing the name to search and choose, and generate the  
report for the specific entity. Leaving this field blank will randomly select the Support/Oppose Memo that applies.

How do I generate Form 498 reports for multiple candidates/committees?
----------

The Form 498 is unique in that a new report is needed for each entity with a Support/Oppose Memo over $2,500 in aggregate in  
the period.

However, if you need to file more than one report, follow these steps to generate multiple Form 498 reports:

1. If you know the name of the Payment entity, you can search for that in the “Entity” drop down. If not, keep the drop down blank.
2. Review the data.
3. Make sure you file the report and then click Mark As Filed once you receive confirmation.
4. Click on regenerate. If you keep the drop down blank, the payee automatically selected in step 1 will be skipped, and the next one automatically selected.
5. Repeat until all payees have a Form 498 report (or the last report is empty).
