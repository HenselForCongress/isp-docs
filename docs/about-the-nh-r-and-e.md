 About the NH – R and E
==========

Applies To: New Hampshire

The NH R and E report lists receipts and expenditures to be reported to the Secretary of State. All contributions and expenditures over $50 will need to be itemized.

Contributions that have exceeded the $200 aggregation threshold will also need to report the following contributor information:

* Occupation
* Job title
* Name of employer
* Location of the place of business

To file your report, you must download the eFiling from ISP and then upload it to the [New Hampshire Campaign Finance System](https://cfs.sos.nh.gov/). If you open the downloaded eFile you might receive a warning message. Don’t worry about it – the file is totally safe.
