 About Other Entities
==========

Other Entities are used for non-corporeal concepts. They’re not widely used but most accounts will have one or two. They generally should be avoided unless absolutely needed.

The most common are:

* **Anonymous**: For when you don’t know where this money came from.
* **Bookkeeping**: For when there has been a manual adjustment to fix a past error.

Some agencies have very specific other entities. Check your agency specific help file documents for more information.
