 What Is the Xodo Sign Integration and How Do I Use It?
==========

The Xodo Sign integration allows you to email necessary documents that require signature. These can be sent directly from within individual records. Please note that you will need a paid version of Xodo Sign in order to be able to integrate with ISP. Pricing options can be found on the [Xodo Sign site](https://eversign.com/pricing).

To begin, first add the Xodo Sign integration to your database by going to the Integrations tab, then to Add/Remove. On the resulting screen, scroll down until you see the Xodo Sign integration option, then click it to add it to your database. 

A window will appear and have two fields.

**Xodo Sign Access Key:** This is used to authenticate eversign API. You can get your API info from within your Xodo Sign account. Go to the top left dropdown menu and select Developer.

**Xodo Sign Business Id:** One requirement for Xodo Sign use is to include Xodo Sign’s API business ID. To get this, log into your account and navigate to the Developer page by going to the dropdown in the top left.

Once you have added these details, you’ll see the Xodo Sign option under the Integrations tab. Once you click this option, you’ll be directed to the Xodo Sign Templates page. On this page will be the templates you previously created within your Xodo Sign account. 

If you’d like to make one of these templates a test only option, click the red Live banner next to the name. This will ask if you want to make this a Sandbox template. To make it Live again, click Sandbox.

After sending out Xodo Sign agreements, you can click the Sent Agreements button at the bottom of the screen to review sent agreements. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the signed and completed document to appear in the recipient’s record in the database as a communication.

How do I send Xodo Sign documents for signature?  

----------

If you need someone to sign documents, first navigate to their individual record. If the individual does not have a record already, please create that record and be sure to include an email address.

At the bottom of the screen is a dropup menu labeled Quick Communications. Click this and you’ll see an option for Send Xodo Sign Agreement. Select this and in the new window that appears, choose which template to send, the Subject of your email, and the message you’d like to send with it. Click the Send Agreement button when ready.

After the individual receives and e-signs the documents, you’ll receive notice it was completed. Also, in the entity’s record, specifically the Communications section, you’ll see a notation for the sent Xodo Sign document, as well as a button to download the agreement.

Why can’t I save the webhook URL in Xodo Sign?
----------

Ensure there are no white spaces at the beginning or end of the URL.

Make sure there are no capital letters in your URL.
