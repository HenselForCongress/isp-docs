 What Is the Initial Account Set Up & Agreement?
==========

The Setup Account page allows you to set up a few initial pieces of your database, including filing information. This page will no longer appear once you agree to the Terms of Service.

There are a couple of items to select in order to get started with your account.

### Political Committee Type ###

Make sure to pick the correct type for your committee. The most common types are Candidate Committees and Political Action Committees.

### Set up Compliance Filing for ###

Select the state agency the compliance reports will be filed with. If this is a FEC only account, select the Federal Election Commission option.

If this is a joint state/federal account, click the checkbox labeled *This account will be used for both state & federal committees*. The dropdown will then allow you to select the state.

Once those options are set, click the checkbox next to the Terms of Service, then the I Agree | Set Up Account button to start the initial setup process and access your account.
