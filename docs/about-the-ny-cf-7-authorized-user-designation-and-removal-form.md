 About the NY Cf-07 (Authorized User Designation and Removal Form)
==========

Applies To: New York

The New York State Board of Elections requires all filers to use the web-based application for financial disclosure reporting. 

The [Authorized User Designation and Removal Form](https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/download/finance/cf07.pdf) is filed by treasurers to designate authorized users or remove users for the New York’s filing. 

NYSBOE permits a treasurer to designate additional authorized users who can access the filer’s EFS Web Application account. Each authorized user will have a different email address and password login than the treasurer has. Authorized users will be able to login into the committee’s account, create report drafts, and add/delete/edit transactions. Authorized users will not be able to submit any reports, as responsbility goes to the treasurer of the committee. 

All of New York’s authorization forms are not e-fillable. The CF-07 must contain an original signature in ink, then mailed to:

NYS Board of Elections   
Attn: Compliance Unit   
40 North Pearl Street, Suite 5   
Albany, NY 12207
