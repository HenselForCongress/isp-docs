 About the CA Form 497 Report
==========

Applies To: California

The CA Form 497 has two main uses:

1. Primarily, a 24-hour Contribution Report, which is required for contributions received or non-independent expenditure made in the amount or aggregate of $1,000 or more, filed within the 90-day period before an election
2. A 10-day report, required for contributions received or non-independent expenditures made in the amount or aggregate of $5,000 or more, filed anytime outside of the 90-day period before an election

Every time a donation is made, the aggregate resets back to $0.

Determining when contributions should pull to a FPPC Form 497 can be confusing. Here are a few examples to help demonstrate situations that are most common.

**Example 1:** A donor gives $800 in aggregate outside of the 90-day reporting period. They then donate $500 in the 90-day reporting period. This $500 amount would not pull because it’s under the $1,000 aggregate amount for the 90-day reporting period.

**Example 2:** A donor gave $500 in the 90-day reporting period. They then give another $600 in the same 90-day reporting period. This donor now aggregates to $1,000 or more in the 90-day reporting period and will need to be reported on a 497.

**Example 3:** A donor gives $1,100 in the 90-day reporting period. This is reported on a 497. The donor then gives another $700 in the 90-day reporting period. This $700 amount is not reported on a 497 because the aggregate has reset back to $0 when the first 497 was filed.

Furthermore, if you are expecting a contribution made (expense to another committee) to pull to a 497 and it is not, then consider these two scenarios:

1. Since the 497, or 24-hour Contribution Report, is based on Support/Oppose Memos, check to make sure there is a Support/Oppose Memo on the contribution made transaction you’re expecting to report.
2. A Political Action Committee (PAC) does not have to report Contributions Received, so Page 1 is automatically excluded for PAC filers.

Please note when the State created the e-filing specifications for the Form 497, they did not add a section where the loan box can be checked. Instead, the document note is used to indicate that it is a loan. The loan box cannot be checked when e-filed; only when paper filed.

When contributions are made to state or local races using federal funds, the itemization rules slightly change. There is no reset, and the contributions made are reported as info, or what we would call memo. These expenses will itemize once they reach the $1,000 threshold and will continue to itemize.

On the other hand, non-federal expenses do reset after they hit the $1,000 threshold.

In order to avoid confusion, we include a memo for every expense. These memos indicate if the expense was made as a member communication and if it was made in support of or in opposition to.
