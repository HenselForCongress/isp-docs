 How Do I Set up Seattle Efiling?
==========

Applies To: Washington

If you need to file your reports with the SEEC (Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission), you will need to ensure your committee is set up correctly first.

1. Navigate to the Filer Committee Record.
2. Ensure the committee info is correct. Make sure Jurisdiction is set to City and Jurisdiction Description is set to Seattle.
3. Next, make sure your committee address is in WA. If your committee address isn’t a Washington state address, you will not be able to file with the SEEC.

Once these steps have been taken, you’ll see an Efile to Seattle button at the bottom of the screen the next time you generate your report.
