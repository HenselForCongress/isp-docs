 About the MN 24 Hour PCF Report
==========

Applies To: Minnesota

The MN 24-Hour PCF Report is for contributions and loans from any one source totaling more than $1,000 during the 24-Hour Reporting Period must be reported to the Board in person by the end of the next business day after receipt or by electronic means within 24 hours after receipt and also on subsequent Reports of Receipts and Expenditures for the year. 

During election years, there is a gap between the last date of the pre-primary-election report and the date of the primary, as well as another gap between the last date of the pre-general election and the general election. During those two time periods, this report needs to be filed if your committee receives a contribution of $1,000 or more. The MN 24-Hour PCF report does not support Loans Received. 

To file, log onto your [state agency’s filing](https://notice.cfb.mn.gov/reporting/login) system for the 24 Hour report.
