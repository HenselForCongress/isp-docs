 What Are Primarily Formed PACs in CA?
==========

Applies To: California

In California there are two types of committees: General Purpose and Primarily Formed PACs. The Primarily Formed PAC has a more specific focus than General Purpose committees.

A Primarily Formed PAC is a committee that supports or opposes a single candidate or measure, or a specific group of measures or local candidates in the same election. 

On the Compliance report, specifically the CA 410, the Primarily Formed committee section must contain the candidate info. In the committee’s record in ISP, the following two pieces of information must be there:

1. The Committee Type is PAC
2. There is a linked Relationship with the Supported/Opposed candidate

With these two conditions met, the supported or opposed candidate info will pull to the appropriate location on the report.
