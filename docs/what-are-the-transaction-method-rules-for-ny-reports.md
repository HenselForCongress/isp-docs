 What Are the Transaction Method Rules for NY Reports?
==========

Applies To: New York

New York has specific requirements and rules when it comes to the method of transaction. Not following these can result in report errors or filing an incorrect report.

* If the transaction method is Check, the transaction number is required to upload the efile.
* If the transaction method is blank or not chosen, a compliance note is required explaining why.

If you do not want to add transaction numbers to all of the check contributions, use a transaction method that is not Check or blank, such as ACH.
