 About the FEC Form 48-IE Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC 48-IE is only filed by political committees. For Non-Committee filers, use the [Form 5](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-5-report/).

The FEC Independent Expenditures Report – Form 48-IE is used to report Independent Expenditures of more than $10,000. This will report Independent Expenditures made by the committee, and estimated expenses will pull to this report.

Please note Schedule E only discoloses Federal candidate or committee info.

If you need to file a report due to an Independent Expenditure over $1,000 within the 20 days before an election, please use the [FEC Form 24-IE Report](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-24-ie/).

There will be situations where the 48-IE and 24-IE reports overlap. Since the same information is reported on both, most use the 24-IE instead of the 48-IE during the 20 days before an election. Please confirm with your FEC analyst if you are not sure which report to use.
