 How Do I Set up the Constant Contact Integration?
==========

The Constant Contact integration will add to or update your list of subscribers in Constant Contact based on new additions to your ISP database or after edits are made to existing entities in the database. 

Before you add the integration to ISP, be sure you have an account already created with Constant Contact.

How do I add the Constant Contact integration in ISP?
----------

Under the Integrations tab, select Add/Remove Integration and scroll down through the Available section until you see Email: Constant Contact, then click on it.

You will automatically be redirected to your Constant Contact account where you’ll be asked to authorize the integration. After clicking to accept it, you’ll then be taken back to your ISP account.

This integration occurs nightly so the next day you will see any entity with an email address in ISP now as a Contact in your Constant Contact account. When you add new individuals to ISP or update existing records, those adds or updates will be made overnight in Constant Contact.

In Constant Contact, click the Contacts tab at the top to view the list. You’ll have insights into your subscriber numbers, any new additions to the list, and more.
