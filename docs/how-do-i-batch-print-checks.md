 How Do I Batch Print Checks?
==========

If you handle multiple accounts and have checks to print, you can print them in batches using cross-account check printing. However, prior to printing, please be sure you are using MICR ink. This stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition and is needed to correctly print specific numbers on the check, such as Account Number, Routing Number, and more.

When searching for checks to print, use the Settings section to determine the starting Check Number for each account you handle. This will be determined by the Check Number used when the expense was created.

In the Settings section is also a drop down menu for Check Format. There are various formats to choose from, though they will all print in three-part checks; one for the receipt, one for the check, and one for your own records. Each format allows for either a pre-lined check or a simple blank check to fill in.

The section below Settings is where you’ll find all available checks to print. Listed will be the Account Name, Date, Amount, and Election. There is a column on the left with check boxes to choose the check, or you can select the box at the top of the column to select all transactions listed and print out all the checks.

When ready, click the Print Checks button at the bottom of the screen to create the check(s).
