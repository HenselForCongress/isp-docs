 How Do I Add Candidate and Committee Records Directly From the FEC?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

In ISP you have the ability to add both a Committee and Candidate record to your database directly from the FEC site when using the Search option at the top of the screen. The information that gets imported in will include key pieces of data, such as address, ID number, and other financial information.

First, if you haven’t yet, enable the FEC Search feature by navigating to the System tab, then to Account Management. On the resulting screen, locate the Account Preferences section and toggle on the option to include the data in searches.

After this feature has been enabled, when searching for committee records that are not in your database, you’ll see the name you were searching for and a message allowing you to import from FEC data.

Clicking this will automatically add the record to your database and add any pertinent information required for filing and standard information purposes.

On the Organization search page under the Add/Search tab, you’ll also see an option to Exclude matches from FEC data. This will help you limit the results on your screen.
