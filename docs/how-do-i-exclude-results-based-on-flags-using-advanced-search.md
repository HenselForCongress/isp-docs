 How Do I Exclude Results Based on Flags Using Advanced Search?
==========

Sometimes, when generating a list, you may want to exclude certain results from the list based on a Flag in the record. Using Advanced Search, you can create this list with an exclude option in the criteria.

First, add the rule that will locate the overall list you have in mind. Once you’ve added it to the Search Criteria section, create another rule in the Add Rule section:

* **Area:** Flags
* **Field:** Flag
* **Relationship:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** (select the Volunteer flag)

At this point, click the red Add as Exclusion button. The Search Criteria will then show two lines of criteria, one with a red Exclude button. This will create a list that excludes any records with the Flag you chose.
