 What Are CA LLC/LLP Reporting Requirements?
==========

Applies To: California

LLCs/LLPs in California have certain rules to follow, including a requirement for the Legal Responsible Officer to be reported, as well.

1. Create the contribution from the LLC. Make sure the entity record’s business type is LLC or LLP.
2. Add a relationship to the person considered the Legal Responsible Officer. It’s best to use the relationship type Employee/Employee of for this. Make sure the relationship is the Primary relationship.

ISP will automatically pull this LLC/LLP contribution to your report as required. This means the Legal Responsible Officer will pull to the donor block for the LLC/LLP contribution on the PDF. On the e-File version of the report, it’ll pull as a text block containing the information indicating the LLC/LLP and Legal Responsible Officer link.
