 About the GA CCDR (Easy Vote) Report
==========

Applies To: Georgia

The Easy Vote Report is for local agencies, such as the City of Atlanta. This report cannot be e-filed with the state, as the Easy Vote e-filing is a different format using .csv files than the state’s e-file .xml format.

At this time, Loan Made, Loan Made Repayment, and Loan Made Balance Reduction are not supported, nor is the Investments schedule.

To file, log into Atlanta’s [campaign finance filing system](https://atlantacity.easyvotecampaignfinance.com/login).
