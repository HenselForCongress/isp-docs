 How Do I Change My Password?
==========

On the Change Password page, you can update your password with a new one. If you are unsure of your password, use the Forgot Password option on the main login page.

To change your password while logged into the database, go to the System tab, then to Change Password. In the window that appears, type in your current password first, then your new password. Click the Change Password button to save the new password.
