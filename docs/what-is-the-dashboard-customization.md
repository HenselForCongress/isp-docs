 What Is the Dashboard Customization?
==========

With the Dashboard Customization, you can determine which sections appear on the dashboard. You can also create various kinds of dashboard layouts to suit specific needs.

To begin, click the Change Layout button at the bottom of the screen. If you already have layouts created, click the name of the layout you’d like to see. Otherwise, to create one, select Manage.

On the resulting screen, click Add Custom Dashboard at the bottom of the screen. You will be redirected to the Dashboard Layout Manager screen. In the Name field, add a title of the layout you want to create. Next, click and drag sections from the left over to the field just below the Name field. 

The available sections are as follows:

* **Announcements:** Displays recent ISP product updates.
