 What Are Key Stats in Consultant Tools?
==========

Similar to Key Stats for Individual records, Key Stats for Consultants provide a robust overview of each database managed by the Firm.

In the main section you’ll see multiple columns. These columns are sortable. Here you’ll be able to see various pieces of data, including record counts, aggregate financial info for Receipts and Disbursements, as well as how many new transactions were added or edited in the last month.

At the bottom of the screen is an option to export the data to an Excel spreadsheet.

Also at the bottom of the screen is a button labeled Refresh Data. Click this to force the system to refresh and display the most current data.
