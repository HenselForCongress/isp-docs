==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The Key Stats on the Dashboard reflect a more specified breakdown of contributions as they are entered. This will most likely differ from Line 11 on your FEC report, as that total will reflect a value that may also contain deductions or fee expenses that will reduce the initial total of the contributions.
