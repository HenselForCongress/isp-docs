 What Are the Sort Order Options for the FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When generating the FEC Reports, you have the ability to set the Sort Order of data that pulls to the report.

Below are explanations for each option and what they allow you to do when sorting data on the report.

**Alphabetical:** With this sort option, transactions on the report will be sorted by entity name. If there are multiple transactions with the same name, they will then sort by date.

**Date:** This sort option allows for transactions to first be sorted by date, then alphabetically if the transactions have the same date.

**Alphabetical (splits with whole):** With Alphabetical (Split with Whole), the whole (parent/main) transaction follows the standard alphabetical sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same name, the splits further itemize by date order. If there is more than one split with the same name AND date, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Date (splits with whole):** With Date (Split with Whole), the whole (parent/main) transaction follows the standard date sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in date order. If there is more than one split with the same date, the splits further itemize by alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same date AND name, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Random:** This sort order option generates the transactions on the report in a random order, disregarding name and date information when determining placement.
