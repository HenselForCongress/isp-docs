 WinRed Integration Troubleshooting
==========

If you are experiencing issues with your WinRed integration, check below to see if your issue is mentioned and if so, how to fix it.

**I just set up my WinRed integration but no transactions are coming over to ISP.**

While there could be a few reasons for this, the most typical one is in the setup process on WinRed’s side. The account name in WinRed should be the “short name” used in ISP. This is the committee name in the top left corner of the ISP screen and is in all caps. 

**I emailed WinRed and had them set up the integration with ISP, but no transactions are coming over to ISP.**

You may not have installed the integration in ISP. Navigate to Tools \> Add/Remove Tools, and locate the WinRed Integration. If you have any trouble setting up your integration, you can find more information [here](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-the-winred-integration/).

If you received some contributions through WinRed and they are not making their way over to ISP, email Support with an example transaction that should’ve came over.

**Still having problems?**

If you’re still having an issue that isn’t addressed by this help file, email Support with an example transaction that you’ve received via WinRed since fully setting up the integration. We can look at our Logs and diagnose the issue.
