 About the NY Weekly/24-Hour Report
==========

Applies To: New York

The NY Weekly and 24 Hour Report Form is used for non Independent Expenditure committees. This generates a 24-hour notice to file with the New York Board of Elections. To file, download the generated file and login to your [state account](https://nysboe.my.idaptive.app/login?yfirtnecapplogin=true&appKey=3d7bad45-c607-468d-911e-c2bf981f4da3&customerId=ABA0374&=&stateId=TY2KW6GSkifmSdZfpDq3wxRWYs0akglEvJi6wljAXg81&yfirtnecrun=true) to import. Please be sure that you are using the 24 Hour report version.

For Independent Expenditure committees, this report can be used to generate either a 24-hour or a Weekly Report disclosure depending on the report version selected. Currently, these disclosures cannot be imported and must be manually copied over.
