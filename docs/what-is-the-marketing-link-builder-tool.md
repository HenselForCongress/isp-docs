 What Is the Marketing Link Builder Tool?
==========

Marketing is an important part of any fundraising endeavor. In ISP, you can create and track marketing links you use for attracting donors, volunteers, or for any other marketing webpage use.

To add a link, click the Add Marketing Link button at the bottom of the page. A window will appear and allow you to populate fields related to your link.

Once you have completed these fields and clicked the Add button, on the main screen you will see three columns that display various useful pieces of information.
