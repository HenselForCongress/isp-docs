 How Do I Use BCC Emails to Add Communications?
==========

When communicating via email, it’s helpful to note in the record of the email recipient that contact was made. Using the BCC Email feature, you can now add a Communication note to the record when the email is sent.

When sending the email, use the following in the Bcc address line:

[short account name]@bcc.ISPolitical.com

Your short account name is the name showing on the far left of the tab menu. It will be in All Caps.

For example, if your campaign is Abe Lincoln for President and your short account name is LINCOLN, the Bcc address you would use is LINCOLN@bcc.ISPolitical.com.

Please be sure the email recipients have a record in the database and the email info is in the record itself. Without this, ISP will not know which record to add the Communication note to.
