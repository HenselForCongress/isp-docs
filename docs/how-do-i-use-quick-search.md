 How Do I Use Quick Search?
==========

One of the ways you can search for various entities in your database is with the Quick Search option. You can utilize this option by clicking on the magnifying glass icon at the top of the page near the Logout button.

In this field, you can search by the following data pieces to find the record you’re looking for:

### Individuals ###

First Name, Last Name, Name Suffix, Nickname, Occupation, Employer, Email Address

### Organizations ###

Name, Website, Aliases, ID Number, EIN, Email Address

### Other Entities ###

Name

Results will display in a scrollable drop-down menu. Highlight the record you were looking for, then click it to access the record itself.
