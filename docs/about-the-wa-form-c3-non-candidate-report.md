 About the WA Form C3 – Non-Candidate Report
==========

Applies To: Washington

The WA Form C3 Non-candidate is a transaction deposit-based report for non-candidate-associated committees. To amend this report, the important thing is to select the previously generated report. An Original Report Number is not needed.

Version Differences:
----------

* **Seattle:** the date reported of a contribution is the date you are notified of the contribution, different than the regular reporting of the date reported is when the contribution is deposited into your bank account. Non-Candidate and Seattle versions itemize contributions if the aggregate exceeds $25. 
* **PDC:** Itemizes all versions and itemizes all contributions. Out-of-state contributions itemize transactions regardless of amount if the state associated with the primary address is not WA.
