Group 2: Accrued Expense Splits

* Transaction Types: Accrued Expense – Splits

Note: Group 2 transactions are reported as a memo when paid. If a memo does not appear under the parent transaction on a report, this may be due to the nature of the original Accrued Expense. According to FEC rules, Splits on the original Accrued Expense only pull when the first Accrued Expense Payment is made.

Group 3: Fees to Conduits

* Transaction Types: Monetary Contributions
* Transaction Tag: Conduit – Conduit Check

Note: Group 2 will be reported as memos.

Note: When the reattribution/redesignation happens across

That’s why you’ll see the original transaction on the report with a memo  
 that says Original Contribution as Previously Reported.
