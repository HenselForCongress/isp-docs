 How Do I Setup a Nevada Legal Defense Fund in ISP?
==========

Applies To: Nevada

Legal Defense Fund contributions and expenditures are reported on the NV Candidate Contributions and Expenditures- Legal Defense Fund Report.   

**Account Setup**

To be able to use this report you will need to add an additional filer committee and financial account to your ISP account. Follow the “How do I add a new filer?” steps [here](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-multiple-filers-or-change-the-existing-filer/) for instructions. When setting up your new filer committee, be sure to select “Legal Defense Fund” as the committee type.

Note: Only contributions and expenditures entered into this new financial account will appear on the Legal Defense Fund report.

**Generating the Report**

When generating your compliance report, choose your new filer committee as the “Filer”. You will now see the NV Candidate Contributions and Expenditures- Legal Defense Fund report option under the Compliance Report drop down menu.
