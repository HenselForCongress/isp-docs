 Why Isn’t the Split of My Accrued Expense Payment Showing on My FEC Report?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The splits of a standard Expense will pull to a report once the established itemization threshold has been met. The splits of an Accrued Expense Payment, on the other hand, will pull to a report ONLY when the first Accrued Expense Payment is made. This is due to FEC rules.

Additionally, because the FEC wants to see splits of Accrued Expenses when the first payment is made, the Accrued Expense Payment may appear on a report other than the report that contained the original Accrued Expense.

However, on the back end, all the Accrued Expenses and Accrued Expense Payment transactions are linked so the FEC can tell which splits belong to which payment.

Here’s an example:

During the final quarter of the year, there is an Accrued Expense to an individual where a vendor is the split.

During the first quarter of the following year, there is a payment to this Accrued Expense.

Since the FEC wants to see splits of Accrued Expenses when the first payment is made, the vendor will pull to the report during the first quarter of the following year, even though the Accrued Expense is from the previous year.
