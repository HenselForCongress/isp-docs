 About the IN CFA11
==========

Applies To: Indiana

The IN CFA11 Report is used to record transactions that meet the Itemization threshold, thus creating a Large Contribution Report. All of the recorded transactions reported on the CFA11 will be shown on a PDF, that will need to be reported to the state. You must then manually enter the itemized transactions into the [Indiana Campaign Finance website](https://campaignfinance.in.gov/CampaignFinance/UserLogin.aspx).

Please ensure that you are marking your reports as filed after you have finished reporting your large contributions to ensure that duplicates are not being pulled to the report.
