 About the IL Schedule B-1
==========

Applies To: Illinois

The IL Schedule B-1 form is used to file Independent Expenditures of $1,000 or more.

Illinois e-filing expects the type of transaction to be submitted with an exact format, including spelling and capitalization. To accommodate the All Caps option, there are some words that will never be in all caps, like Contribution or Expenditure.
