 How Do I Add Refunds to Integrations Deposits?
==========

Sometimes you receive notices about refunds from an Integration source, such as ActBlue or another donation system. It’s important to add them to ISP correctly for not only accurate reporting but also for financial accuracy.

First, if you haven’t already, create the refund for the transaction(s) in question.

Once you have created the refunds or if they are already in the system, navigate to the deposit in question. This can be found in your Register. Click to access and view the deposit details, then locate the Add Deducted Fees button at the bottom of the screen.

In the Add Deducted Fees menu, you’ll see several options. To add the refund to the deposit, click Existing Refund, then locate and click the refund you’ve created.

Once back on the main deposit details screen, click the Update Deposit button.
