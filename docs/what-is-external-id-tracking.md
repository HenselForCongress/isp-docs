 What Is External ID Tracking?
==========

The External Data Sources tool tracks ID Numbers and other  
identifiers from external software programs and data sources. This tool  
will add a new section to Individual and Organization records where you  
can add more details.

* External IDs must be unique per external system.
* External IDs will work with quick searches. 
* We can also build quick imports that will bring in external IDs. Email us for more information on this.
