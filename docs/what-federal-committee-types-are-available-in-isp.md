 What Federal Committee Types Are Available in ISP?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When setting up your federal filer committee record, you will need to select a committee type. Below is a list of options.

**Candidate:** An individual seeking nomination for election, or reelection, to a federal office. (US House, US Senate, President)

**Other:** Individuals, groups, corporations and labor organizations that are not registered as a political committee. 

**Party:** A political committee that represents a political party and is part of the official party structure at the national, state or local level.

**Political Action Committee (PAC):** A political committee that is neither a party committee nor an authorized committee of a candidate. Joint Fundraising Committees that support at least one party or non-party political committee (such as a PAC) should select PAC as their committee type. If your JFC only supports federal candidates and needs to file an FEC Form 3 instead, click here for additional instructions.

**Super PAC:** Independent expenditure-only political committees that may receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other political action committees for the purpose of financing independent expenditures and other independent political activity. These committees are not limited on what contributions they can receive or spend, but they cannot give directly to candidates or regular PACs.

**527 Political Organization:** Political organizations that do not expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate or party. They instead raise and spend money for the purposes of issue advocacy and voter mobilization.
