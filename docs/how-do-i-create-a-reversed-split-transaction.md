 How Do I Create a Reversed Split Transaction?
==========

Reversed Splits are uncommon, but they do happen. For example, you use the campaign credit card to pay for an order at a taco shop that totals $50. Due to poor service, the taco shop has decided to fully reimburse you. On your following bank statement, you’ll have an Expense of -$50. This is entered as a Reversed Split.

If the original transaction with the splits has not already been added, add them as they originally happened before any refunds or returns.  

If you need to make an existing split a Reversal, navigate to that entity’s record (the split in question) and locate the transaction. Next, click on the transaction to edit it, and towards the top, click the box for Is Reversal. Click the Save button to save the split transaction as a Reversed Split.

If you need to add a new split as a Reversal, just click the Is Reversal box as you create the split.
