 What Are Call Sheets?
==========

Call Sheets allow you to have donor information in front of you when calling potential contributors, including both contact information and donation information. 

The Call Sheets management page allows you to manage how call sheets display needed information when they are printed and/or viewed. 

Under the Tools tab, select Call Sheets. If you don’t see this as an option, click Add/Remove Tools, scroll until you see the Call Sheets option, then click it to add it to your database. 

On the Call Sheets page, you’ll see two sections.

**Flag Display:** Using this option, you can determine how you want Flags to appear on Call Sheets. If you prefer to see the Flag description, select Description. Otherwise, to just see the Name, select Name. 

**Included Key Stats:** Here you can choose which four Key Stats you’d like to see on the Call Sheet, as well as the order in which they appear on the page. To switch them out or move them around, click and drag each one to the desired position. 

Any changes you make on this page will show immediately on printed Call Sheets moving forward.
