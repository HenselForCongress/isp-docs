 About the FL DS-DE Report
==========

Applies To: Florida

The Florida DS-DE Report summarizes all contributions, expenditures, and other distributions for a given reporting period. To disclose an organization’s Nature of Business, the organization record’s Industry field should be edited to include that information. This field can be found by clicking on the Edit button in the top right corner of the organization’s record.

Due to the sequence numbers assigned to transactions on this report, we cannot add a Sort Order option when generating this report.
