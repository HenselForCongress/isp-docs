 How Do I Create the eFundraising Connections Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

eFundraising Connections is a payment processing platform allowing you to collect donations and track donor contact data. There are no start up or monthly subscription fees to use the program, and it easily integrates with ISP. Before you set up the integration in ISP, be sure you have your eFundraising Connections account set up, as well.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from eFundraising Connections via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, eFundraising Connections will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

### How do I install the eFundraising Connections integration? ###

1. Under the Integrations tab, select Add/Remove Integrations  
2. Scroll down to the Available section and locate eFundraising Connections  
3. Click on it to add it to the Installed section

At this point, in another tab, log into your eFundraising account.

1. Navigate to the Integrations section  
2. Check the box next to ISPolitical, and enter the Account Name. Make sure to use your short account name. This is the name that appears in the top left of your screen next to the text ISP:.

If you encounter any trouble with this portion of the set up, please contact the support team at eFundraising Connections.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create an eFundraising Connections organization record in the account with the eFundraising Connection’s details.

When data is passed to ISP, it will appear in the [Pending Imports section](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) of your Dashboard.
