 How Do I Add a Contribution to Other Committees?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When adding a contribution made to another committee, it’s important for both financial and compliance purposes the data entry is correct.

First, navigate to the record of the committee you’ve made a payment to.

In the Transactions section, click the + (Add) symbol to add a new transaction, then choose Expense.

Enter in the available details of the transaction and in the Reporting Code drop down, select 011 – Political Contributions.

Next, click Specify Support/Oppose and fill in the applicable details.

If the donation is to a candidate committee, it is to support a candidate. Please be sure you use the candidate of the committee for the Support/Oppose section. Note: The candidate’s record must already be in your database to properly link the supporting transaction.
