 Issues With California’s PDF Converting Program
==========

Applies To: California

If you are attempting to convert the .cal file into a PDF using the program downloaded off the California site, you will most likely encounter display issues. This program has rarely been updated in over 20 years and is still generating the 1999 PDF version of report. Because of this, we don’t recommend using their PDF converter.

If you need to view the PDF of the report, even though the filer may be a paper only filer, we recommend downloading the PDF version, too, after you generate the report in ISP. We update our system regularly so the PDF you download in ISP will ensure you have the right version of the report in your records.
