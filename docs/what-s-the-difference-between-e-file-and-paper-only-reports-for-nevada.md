 What’s the Difference Between E-file and Paper Only Reports for Nevada?
==========

Applies To: Nevada

###  ###

The state of Nevada determines what transactions are itemized. Because of this, we have two versions: Paper Only, to review and see how the report will look on the state’s site, and E-File, to ensure all transactions are properly transmitted to the state for accurate aggregation. Nevada state law requires all C&E Reports and Financial Disclosure Statements to be filed electronically using the AURORA Campaign Finance Disclosure system.

**Version: Paper Only**

* When you generate a Paper Only version, the itemization is pre-set to $100.01.
* Paper Only Versions are used for the sole purpose of review in order to get an approximation of the state’s itemization.

**Version: E-Filing**

* Due to Nevada’s limitations of E-File procedures, our system uploads all transactions. The state will perform the calculations on their end to determine what is to be itemized. 
* If you create a PDF and generated the report using the E-File version, all transactions will be itemized on that same PDF. This will not give you an accurate representation of how the report displays on the state’s site after uploading. 

**Notes About Uploading E-Files and using AURORA**

* AURORA does not have the ability to link any loan forgiveness transaction to its original loan. This will require you to manually enter those into the state’s system. 
* When you generate the report using the E-File version, that same E-File will be downloaded via a .zip folder. Inside that .zip folder you will see two files: Contributions.csv and Expenditures.csv. 
* You can then use those two CSV files to bulk upload transactions, which will then be moved over to the AURORA electronic filing system.
