 What Is a Bookkeeping Transaction and How Do I Add One?
==========

Sometimes a quick correction to Cash On Hand balances on reports is needed. You can do this by utilizing the Bookkeeping option on the Other Entities page.

In order to find out the specific bookkeeping transaction type needed, first determine if the COH total is higher or lower than expected.

* If the COH is lower, create a contribution with a date far in the past, such as 1/1/1900, in the amount that’s the difference.
* If the COH total is higher, create an expense in that amount, again with a date far in the past.

Please be aware these are quick fixes and should only be used after all discrepancy research has been completed and no solution is found.

### How do I add a bookkeeping transaction? ###

Under the Lists tab, click Other Entities. On the resulting page, if you do not see Bookkeeping showing in the Name section, click Add Other Entity at the bottom of the screen and add one. 

When you have added it or if you are ready to add the transaction, click Bookkeeping. You’ll be directed to a page where you can add the transaction. Click the add plus sign in the right corner of the Transactions section to get started.
