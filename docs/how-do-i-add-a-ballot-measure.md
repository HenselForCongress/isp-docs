There are two ways of adding Ballot Measures to the database, either on the Other Entities page under the Lists tab or when creating a transaction.

How do I add a Ballot Measure on the Other Entities page?

2. Click the Add Other Entity button at the bottom of the screen
3. In the window that appears, for Type, be sure to click Ballot Measure. Besides just the Name field, you’ll then see new fields appear: Ballot Measure Name, Letter or Number, Jurisdiction, and Jurisdiction Description. Of these, the Ballot Measure Name and Jurisdiction fields are required.
4. When the info has been added, click Add Other Entity to add the Ballot Measure to the Other Entities list

How do I add a Ballot Measure through a transaction?

How do I link a ballot measure and ballot measure committee?

committee, navigate to the committee record and complete the following  
steps.

Note on Names

----------

----------

When naming the Ballot Measure, it is good practice to  
be able to know the difference between the Ballot Measure name and the  
name of the Ballot Measure Committee. This will lessen the confusion  
when attempting to link Ballot Measures to Ballot Measure Committees and  
 avoid system errors.

**Ballot Measure:** This is the name on the ballot.

**Ballot Measure Committee:** This is what the organization supporting the ballot measure is called.
