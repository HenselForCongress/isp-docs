 What Are Aggregates by Relationships on CA Report?
==========

Applies To: California

California has special rules for aggregating between associated entities when it comes to compliance reports. For example, a donation from a single owner small business is aggregated with donations from the owner for the purpose of campaign limits.

As a result, ISP has the ability to account for donations that come from a business and the individual in our limit checking. Using relationships, the totals will aggregate and be subject to any thresholds determined by the state.

The following is a list of Relationships where this will come into play:

* Owner / Owner Of (Ind / Org)
* Parent Company / Subsidiary (Org / Org)
* Commonly Controlled / Commonly Controlled (Org / Org)
