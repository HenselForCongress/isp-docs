 What Is the Multi-Account Dashboard?
==========

When you first log in, you’ll see the Multi-Account Dashboard. Here you choose the account that you’ll be working in. For each account, you’ll see the Key Stats. These can be customized by selecting the Set Key Stats Display button in the footer. This will pull up a menu where you can select from various Key Stats to display on your Multi-Account Dashboard. Only users with permission to view and export financial information can view the Key Stats on the Multi-Account Dashboard.

You will also see a Refresh Key Stats option among the footer buttons. These Key Stats will update once per day on their own, but if you see something that doesn’t look current, then you can update them as you see fit.
