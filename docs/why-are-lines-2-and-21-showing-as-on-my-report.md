 Why Are Lines 20 and 21 Showing as $0.00 on My Report?
==========

Applies To: California

Per California Law, Lines 20 and 21 are not required to be reported for all committees. When not required, we will report $0.00 on each line.

For lines 20 and 21 to be completed, all the following conditions must be met:

* The reporting period is either Pre-Election or Semi-Annual.
* The current election is a General election.  

* The filer type is candidate.
* The candidate associated with the filer has “State” for their jurisdiction.  

When all four of these conditions are met, Lines 20 and 21 will populate.
