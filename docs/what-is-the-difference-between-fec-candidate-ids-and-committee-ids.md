 What Is the Difference Between FEC Candidate IDs and Committee IDs?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When filing with the FEC, you will work with two FEC IDs: your Candidate ID and Committee ID. Both FEC IDs will be 9 characters long and alpha-numeric. They are not randomly generated numbers; your Committee ID will always start with C00, but the Candidate ID will look different based on your Candidate’s election.

**Candidate ID** 

Candidate ID will not change over time, as long as your candidate is running for the same office. *H2IA03101* and *S2IA00172* are both examples of a Candidate ID running for office in Iowa.

The FEC ID starting with H means the candidate is running for House and the ID starting with S is running for Senate. Then the ID will have the state’s abbreviation within the ID.

**Committee IDs**

Committee IDs will always start with *C00* (C-zero-zero) and the ID does not change once it is handed out. *C00784082* and *C00791525* are both examples of a Committee IDs for Candidates running for office in Iowa.
