# WHAT ARE CALL SHEETS

What Are Call Sheets?
==========

Call Sheets allow you to have donor information in front of you when calling potential contributors, including both contact information and donation information.

The Call Sheets management page allows you to manage how call sheets display needed information when they are printed and/or viewed.

Under the Tools tab, select Call Sheets. If you don’t see this as an option, click Add/Remove Tools, scroll until you see the Call Sheets option, then click it to add it to your database.

On the Call Sheets page, you’ll see two sections.

**Flag Display:** Using this option, you can determine how you want Flags to appear on Call Sheets. If you prefer to see the Flag description, select Description. Otherwise, to just see the Name, select Name.

**Included Key Stats:** Here you can choose which four Key Stats you’d like to see on the Call Sheet, as well as the order in which they appear on the page. To switch them out or move them around, click and drag each one to the desired position.

Any changes you make on this page will show immediately on printed Call Sheets moving forward.

# HOW DO I ENTER CONDUIT AND EARMARKED TRANSACTIONS

How Do I Enter Conduit and Earmarked Transactions?
==========

Campaigns often get conduit (also know as earmarked) contributions that are passed through another political committee, such as ActBlue or WinRed. In these situations, you may be required to report both the original donor and the political committee, also called the Conduit. Conduits only apply when the organization doing the processing is a political committee. For businesses such as eFundraising, you just directly enter the contributions.

When it comes to the data entry of these transactions, it’s important to be sure you’re adding them correctly, as they can and will have an effect on Compliance reports

If you have a transfer coming from a conduit that won’t be sent until after the filing period closes, as is always the rule of thumb with ISP, enter what actually happened. Add the conduit check with the date that it was received and add each individual donor as splits with the dates that those donors made their original contributions. ISP will automatically handle getting this properly reported on your FEC report.

What are the different types of conduit transactions?
----------

There are three types of conduit transactions:

* **Conduit Checks:** This is when a check or other transfer comes from conduit. It may include the donation from one or more donors and fees may be deducted. This is the most common method.
* **Donor Checks:** Where the donor has written a check directly to your committee but the physical check was passed through the conduit.
* **Inkind:** This very rare transaction takes place when a donor makes an inkind contribution to a conduit for the explicit purposes of assisting your campaign.

How do I enter these in the system?
----------

**Conduit Check**

These are entered as monetary contributions. As the check to your committee was from the conduit, the conduit should be the entity for the main transaction. It should be entered the same as other monetary contributions with the following notes:

* **Date:** For the FEC and most states, use the date the check or transfer was received. A few states require that the postmark date is used. Please check your state’s laws.
* **Amount:** The amount of the check or transfer. If fees were deducted, you should still enter the actual amount transferred.
* **Tag:** Select Conduit – Conduit Check
* **Splits:** Enter each individual donor as a split. For their amount, choose the original amount they designated. Do not subtract out fees. No tags are needed on these splits.

*Note on Fees: Please see our separate help file on how ISP automates fee calculations and reporting.*

**Donor Checks Data Entry**

These are also entered as monetary contributions. As the check to your committee was from the individual donor, they should be the entity for the main transaction and it should be the same as other monetary contributions with the following notes:

* **Date:** For the FEC and most states, this is the date the contribution was received as the conduit. Please check with your state to confirm regulations.
* **Tag:** Select Conduit – Donor Check
* **Splits:** Enter the conduit organization as a split. For donor checks, you must also add the Conduit – Donor Check tag to this split. Enter the date you received the transaction. For the amount, enter the total of all checks received in the batch from the Conduit.

*Note: If you need to add additional splits (for partnerships, for example), you may do so. These should not have the Conduit – Donor Check tag.*

**Conduit Inkind Data Entry**

These are entered as inkind contributions. The conduit should be the original donor. Enter as other inkind contributions.

* **Date:** The date the service/goods were received.
* **Tag:** Select Conduit – Inkind
* **Splits:** Enter the conduit. For the date use the date the conduit notified your committee of the inkind. Enter the same amount as for the main transaction.

**State Reporting of Conduits**

Not all agencies require conduit reporting. For many states, if you receive contributions via WinRed or ActBlue (or other conduits), you can report them as regular donations.

For example, WA does not require contributions received via WinRed or ActBlue to be reported as conduits. You can report them as direct contributions. However, in CA it is recommended you report them as received via a conduit.

# WHAT IS DATA FLOW AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Data Flow and How Do I Use It?
==========

The Data Flow tool is for ongoing transfers of data from one account to another. For one-time copies, we recommend using the [Advanced Search copy feature](https://ispolitical.com/How-Do-I-Copy-Data-Between-My-Accounts/).

Data Flow is designed to allow you to manage the core accounting functionality in a single account and transfer that data to other accounts. This is most commonly used by multi-agency filers.

Contact ISP Support to create a new Data Flow. We will set up the transfer link and transfer rules for you. The request for Data Flow setup needs to be authorized by the database owner or a super admin.

Transfer rules options are whether to include Transactions with from date, Transaction Type, and Financial Accounts, and whether to include Third Party Donations. You can also choose to transfer Entities and not financial records.

After we set up the original link and transfer rules on our end, you can set the transfer to run automatically or trigger the transfer right there on the spot. This will be found in the Consultant Tools menu in the bottom right corner of your screen.

If you choose the Automatic Transfer option, slide the toggle from Off to On. The transfer happens overnight each night.

If you prefer to perform the data transfer on your schedule, click the Transfer Now button to make that happen immediately. To avoid unnecessary discrepancies, we recommend using manual transfers after confirming the accuracy of data.

**Important: Data Flow only transfers newly added entity records and financial transactions and does not transfer updates to already transferred records and transactions.**

|---------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Accrued Expense   |     No     |       Yes       |                                           Accrued expenses don’t impact your cash balance because they haven’t been paid yet. When paid, it impacts your cash balance as an accrued expense payment. Accrued expenses are a type of debt.                                           |
|   Accrued Income    |     No     |       Yes       |         Accrued Income is when incoming money is expected but not yet received. For example, an invoice is sent and the other entity agrees to pay the invoice but hasn’t yet. When the money is received, the payment is created as an Accrued Income Payment transaction.         |
| Allocation Transfer |    Yes     |       Yes       |This is a transfer between associated State and Federal committees. It assists with handling federal regulations related to allocating contributions and expenses between State and Federal funds. Use Internal Transfers for transfers between different accounts of the same filer.|
| Enforceable Pledge  |     No     |       No        |                                                                                                  Contributions that have been pledged to be given, but have not yet been realized.                                                                                                  |
|       Expense       |    Yes     |       Yes       |                                                                                        Expenses are the cost required for something/money spent on something for your campaign or committee.                                                                                        |
|In-Kind Contribution |     No     |       No        |                                                                                                       Transactions that are considered a gift of something rather than money.                                                                                                       |
|  Internal Transfer  |     No     |       No        |                 Internal Transfers allow you to move funds between accounts. They are for non-reportable transfers or, in other words, transfers between accounts under the same filer. Use Allocation Transfers for transfers between different filer committees.                  |
|      Loan Made      |    Yes     |       Yes       |                                                                             Money that is given that is intended to be repaid. Unlike an accrued expense, a loan involves an actual transfer of money.                                                                              |
|    Loan Received    |    Yes     |       Yes       |                                                                                                           Money that is received that your committee intends to pay back.                                                                                                           |
|Monetary Contribution|    Yes     |       Yes       |                                                                                                                   Donations made towards your committee/campaign.                                                                                                                   |
|Non-Monetary Expense |     No     |       No        |                            A transfer of a good or service that does not require the use of funds. For example, transferring already owned office furniture to another committee. This is almost always used in conjunction with a Support/Oppose Memo.                             |
|    Other Income     |    Yes     |       Yes       |                                                                               Any type of income received that is not listed in the above transaction types. Sometimes referred to as Other Receipts.                                                                               |

###  Cash Impact  ###

Transactions with a cash impact will impact the amount of available funds, either in your bank account or in undeposited funds. You can see cash impact using financial reports such as either the Cash Flow or the Register report.

### Net Worth Impact ###

Most simple transactions have the same cash and net worth impact. However, for more complex accrual/debt-related transactions, the cash and net worth impact may differ. For example, a loan received will increase your cash, but since the money is still owed, it does not change your net worth.

You can see your current net worth by running the Net Worth report.

# ABOUT THE PA DSEB 5 2 VERSION FEDERAL PAC FILING STATE REPORT

About the PA DSEB-502 Version: Federal PAC Filing State Report
==========

Applies To: Pennsylvania – Political Action Committees (PACs)

A Federal PAC may make contributions or expenditures to Pennsylvania candidates if it is also registered as a PAC with the state. In addition to filing reports with the Federal Election Commission, it must also timely file reports with the State of Pennsylvania.

For PACs this applies to, use the Federal PAC Filing State Report version of the PA Form-DSEB-502. If you do not see this report version available to you, please contact support.

This report version will include the following:

* All contributions received by the PAC
* Itemized expenditures made to PA candidates
* A lump sum expenditure entry of all Non-Pennsylvania Expenditures

You will not need to manually enter this lump sum amount. The software will calculate the total of all your non-PA expenditures and automatically add this entry to the report.

In order for expenditures made to PA state candidates to be itemized on the report, you will need to include a support/oppose memo on the transaction. Click here for instructions on how to add support/oppose memos.

# WHAT ARE UNITS

What Are Units?
==========

Units are used for tracking significant breakdowns, such as Bargaining Units, tracking work places or non-member groups, and to group activity in your database, including financial reporting. After adding a Unit, link the appropriate financial accounts to it to ensure transactions using that account apply to the specific activity for that Unit.

They are also used for security. Users will only have access to the records of the individuals and organizations associated with a Unit that user has been assigned. If a user should have access to all records, be sure to give them the All Units role.

How do I add a Unit to the database?
----------

In order to use Units in your database, navigate to the Tools menu, then click Add/Remove. Either search for Units in the search field or scroll down until you see the Units option. Click it to add it to your database. Under the Lists tab, you’ll then see the Units option.

If you’d like to add an icon based on your Unit, click [Set Icon] to perform an image search, then click the symbol you like. This will be added along with the Unit name to the record when the Unit is added.

Units can be removed by clicking the red X. If a Unit is in use, it will be made inactive rather than deleted.

# WHAT ARE TIME TRACKING CATEGORIES

What Are Time Tracking Categories?
==========

Time Tracking Categories are a way for you to help keep the various ways you are tracking staff and/or volunteer hours. For example, if you have a volunteer going door to door and you want to keep track of the date and times the volunteer was out in the area, you can create a Door to Door category for that purpose.

After Time Tracking Categories have been added, they’ll be available for use in the [Time Tracking](https://ispolitical.com/What-Is-Time-Tracking/?refresh=30783) section of the staff or volunteer’s individual record in the database.

# HOW DO I SET UP THE DROPBOX INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up the Dropbox Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

With the Dropbox integration, you can house documents within records, transactions, and other various parts of ISP. This will allow you to, for example, track records or donors or potential communications you may receive.

How do I add the integration to ISP?

----------

1. First, go to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove Integrations.
2. On the resulting screen, locate and click the Dropbox integration option.
3. A browser window should appear and direct you to sign into your Dropbox account. Once you sign in, you’ll then be redirected back to ISP.

If you handle multiple accounts and have already logged into Dropbox, you may not be directed to Dropbox. Instead, the screen may refresh and show Dropbox in the Installed area of the Integrations page.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a Dropbox organization record in the account with the Dropbox’s details.

After you receive the message stating the integration was added successfully, you’ll see the Dropbox icon within records, when adding transactions to a record, and also as a general folder on the Dashboard.

Clicking on the Dropbox icon will open another small window off in the top right corner. Click the + symbol to add a file to the Dropbox folder. If the folder already includes documents, you’ll see them listed so you don’t duplicate files or if you need to remove a file.

Troubleshooting
----------

From time to time, you may get an error when adding a file to Dropbox due to too many requests. Waiting will normally resolve this. You can also remove and then re-add the integration.

# HOW DO I SET UP A KINDFUL INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up a Kindful Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

Adding a Kindful integration has specific steps to take in order to ensure contributions are synced correctly.

Navigate to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove. Scroll until you see the Kindful integration in the Available section, then click it to add it. You’ll then be directed to the Kindful login page. Once you log in to your Kindful account, you’ll be redirected back to ISP where Kindful will now be included as an integration.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a Kindful organization record in the account with Kindful’s details.

Back in your Kindful account, when you set up a fund, there is a specific format you will need to use to make sure the data can be mapped correctly in ISP.

If this format isn’t followed the data will not sync:

Fund Name = Filer: ElectionName

Examples:

Fund Name = Zach Morris for Prez: G-2020

Fund Name = ZachPAC: Non-Election

Fund Name = MorrisCares PAC: O-1950

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Kindful via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Kindful will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

# HOW DO I REPORT ADVANCES FOR TRAVEL

How Do I Report Advances for Travel?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

During a campaign, an individual sometimes uses their personal funds or personal credit to pay a vendor for a committee expense and is later reimbursed by the committee. This is called an Advance of Personal Funds.

There are different rules depending if it is for Travel or Non-Travel Advance. This helpfile will cover Advances for Travel. Please see this help file for [Advances of Personal Funds](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-enter-an-advance-of-personal-funds-for-fec-reporting/).

Per the FEC, An individual (including the candidate, a paid staff member or a volunteer) may voluntarily spend up to $1,000 for unreimbursed transportation expenses on behalf of the campaign without making a contribution. However, anything over that amount that is NOT reimbursed is considered an inkind contribution. There are additional rules regarding reimbursement. Please see the [FEC page for additional information](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/travel/).

### Rules for Reporting Reimbursed Travel Funds ###

* If the total travel amount reimbursed is $500 or less, splits are not required. (However, we strongly encourage you to include them).
* If the total travel amount reimbursed is over $500, splits ARE required.
* If the reimbursement is not made in the same period, enter the reimbursement to the individual as an Accrued Expense, with the vendors paid as splits. When the individual is reimbursed, record this as an Accrued Expense Payment.

For additional information about reporting, please see the [FEC Page on this topic](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/travel-reimbursements/).

# WHY ARE MY INKINDS ITEMIZING ON SCHEDULE B

Why Are My Inkinds Itemizing on Schedule B?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

In-kind transactions are designed to have no cash impact. When it comes to FEC reports, the balancing act has already been figured out.

On the report you’ll see the transaction on both Schedule A (Receipts) and Schedule B (Disbursements). In order for the schedule totals, as well as other overall cash on hand totals, to balance, we automatically add the balancing transaction on the corresponding schedule.

For example, if you create an In-kind received transaction, which will appear on Schedule A. When you generate the FEC report, you’ll see it on Schedule A and a cash balancing transaction on Schedule B. This is expected by the FEC.

# HOW DO I CREATE A REVERSED SPLIT TRANSACTION

How Do I Create a Reversed Split Transaction?
==========

Reversed Splits are uncommon, but they do happen. For example, you use the campaign credit card to pay for an order at a taco shop that totals $50. Due to poor service, the taco shop has decided to fully reimburse you. On your following bank statement, you’ll have an Expense of -$50. This is entered as a Reversed Split.

If the original transaction with the splits has not already been added, add them as they originally happened before any refunds or returns.

If you need to make an existing split a Reversal, navigate to that entity’s record (the split in question) and locate the transaction. Next, click on the transaction to edit it, and towards the top, click the box for Is Reversal. Click the Save button to save the split transaction as a Reversed Split.

If you need to add a new split as a Reversal, just click the Is Reversal box as you create the split.

# WHAT ARE COMMUNICATION TYPES

What Are Communication Types?
==========

In the Communications section in any entity record, you can track calls, text messages, emails, and other forms of communications for that entity. In ISP, we have created various Communication Types to cover most situations; however, you can edit these or create your own. All Communication Types are customizable.

Communications are included in several Fundraising/Analysis reports. Consequently, their use illustrates how much effort went into a fundraising campaign rather than relying on campaign results.

How do I Create Custom Communication Types or create my own?
----------

Navigate to the Lists tab, then select Communication Types. On the resulting screen, click Add Communication Type to create a new one or click an existing one to edit it. You will see a pop-up appear in both cases with a field called Communication Type. This is where you enter the new name or change an existing name.

Once saved, your Communication Type will become an additional option for any new communications created. If you are editing an existing Communication Type, any communications already applied to that Communication Type will change to the new name you enter. This makes it easier to mass change a communication without editing every record.

If you try to delete a Communication Type that has communications associated with it, our system will make that Communication Type inactive instead of deleting it. This means existing data will remain as is, but no new communications can be applied to that Communication Type. You can click on the inactive button next to the Communication to reactivate it if needed again.

# HOW DO I FILTER MY ADVANCED SEARCH BY STATE AND LOCAL DISTRICTS

How Do I Filter My Advanced Search by State and Local Districts?
==========

In Advanced Search you can filter by Congressional District but not by State Legislative Districts. Unfortunately, the shear number of different districts across the country and the lack of registry material identifying them makes supporting that search unfeasible.

Advanced Search does, however, have some methods you can use to filter by State and Local Districts.

Method 1: Search by Distance
----------

The simplest method would be to search by Distance.

* **Area:** Addresses
* **Field:** Distance

In the pop-up, enter an address that is roughly in the middle of the district you are looking in.

* **Relationship:** Is Less Than
* **Value:** Enter in the distance in miles

The system will pull all addresses that are within that distance from the initial address you selected. Depending on the mile distance you chose, this can take longer than usual, so expect to wait a few minutes for results.

This method will get you a very general filter and works best with rounder, more compact districts.

Method 2: Search by City
----------

This method is much slower but a much more accurate method would be to create a search using each City in the district. This process involves different search groups.

First, start with the City.

* **Area:** Address
* **Field:** City
* **Relationship:** Is
* **Value:** (name of City)

Click Add Rule, then New Search Group. Make sure you hit New Search Group between each City you add as a rule. Similar to using Is Any Of as the Relationship, this will let the system search for results that match any one of the Search Groups rather than all of them.

When you click Run Search, the system will locate all records that have an address in any of the cities you entered. If using cities is not accurate enough for what you need, you can also do this using Zip Codes.

If you expect to run this specific search frequently, click Save & Run Search to save the search criteria for future report generation.

# I DIDNT FILE MY REPORT WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW

I Didn’t File My Report, What Should I Do Now?
==========

We understand that sometimes reports are forgotten or get neglected to be filed. If you find yourself in this situation, we have some recommendations on what you should do.

**File as soon as you can:** In the case of not filing, we recommend to file as soon as you can, even if your report isn’t perfect, filing something is always better than not filing at all. We can always assist in helping you get an amendment filed to clear up discrepancies.

**File an amendment:** This will hopefully negate the agency noticing a mistake and requesting more information or in a worst case scenario you facing a fine.

**Call your agency:** If you are in a situation where you haven’t filed and aren’t sure how to proceed with filing, you can always contact your agency to give you guidance on what your next steps should be. Once you have that information, we can help you complete those steps to keep you compliant.

# TIPS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR THE NEW YORK CF 1 REPORT

Tips and Best Practices for the New York CF-01 Report
==========

Applies To: New York

The NY CF-01 report can be a complicated report to get right. Below are some common areas that sometimes can result in report issues and what needs to be done to ensure the data appears on the report correctly.

**Business Types:** We suggest using the Set Business Type AI option to cover your bases. For records with LLC, Inc. or LLP in the title but no Business Type has been set, AI will automatically set this for you. Again, this has a significant benefit for NY reporting.

When it comes to entity types, New York has entities like PLLCs and PLLPs. They are reported the same as LLCs and LLPs, respectively, so there will be no difference in data entry.

**Monetary Contributions from LLCs, Partnerships, or LLPs:** These transaction types need to report their ownership or partnership shares. This is done by adding Splits to each partner or owner based on the percentage of partnership or ownership. Be sure to create new records for the partners and attribute the Splits to those records rather than to the LLP or LLC and leaving a note.

Please note if the data entry is correct, you’ll see these appear on Schedule O (Partners/Subcontractors) of the report.

**Opening E-Filings**

We generally discourage opening e-files in other programs because it can cause errors when trying to file the report. However, if you do need to open the e-file, do so in Notepad or Notepad++. Do not open these files in Excel (or a similar app), as doing so will delete many of the required columns.

**Reimbursements:** These need to be made to the reimbursee with Reporting Code REIMB. The items being reimbursed should then be added as Splits and all of them should have their own Reporting Codes

**Transaction Methods:** Be sure to select a transaction method for any monetary transactions, as required by the NYBOE. If you are unsure or if none of the transaction methods apply, include an explanation why in your compliance note.

**Transaction Numbers:** New York requires that all transactions made through Check must have a check number reported. If you see a Fatal Error on your report for a Required Transaction Number, this is why.

# WHAT IS THE XODO SIGN INTEGRATION AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is the Xodo Sign Integration and How Do I Use It?
==========

The Xodo Sign integration allows you to email necessary documents that require signature. These can be sent directly from within individual records. Please note that you will need a paid version of Xodo Sign in order to be able to integrate with ISP. Pricing options can be found on the [Xodo Sign site](https://eversign.com/pricing).

To begin, first add the Xodo Sign integration to your database by going to the Integrations tab, then to Add/Remove. On the resulting screen, scroll down until you see the Xodo Sign integration option, then click it to add it to your database.

A window will appear and have two fields.

**Xodo Sign Access Key:** This is used to authenticate eversign API. You can get your API info from within your Xodo Sign account. Go to the top left dropdown menu and select Developer.

**Xodo Sign Business Id:** One requirement for Xodo Sign use is to include Xodo Sign’s API business ID. To get this, log into your account and navigate to the Developer page by going to the dropdown in the top left.

Once you have added these details, you’ll see the Xodo Sign option under the Integrations tab. Once you click this option, you’ll be directed to the Xodo Sign Templates page. On this page will be the templates you previously created within your Xodo Sign account.

If you’d like to make one of these templates a test only option, click the red Live banner next to the name. This will ask if you want to make this a Sandbox template. To make it Live again, click Sandbox.

After sending out Xodo Sign agreements, you can click the Sent Agreements button at the bottom of the screen to review sent agreements. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the signed and completed document to appear in the recipient’s record in the database as a communication.

How do I send Xodo Sign documents for signature?

----------

If you need someone to sign documents, first navigate to their individual record. If the individual does not have a record already, please create that record and be sure to include an email address.

At the bottom of the screen is a dropup menu labeled Quick Communications. Click this and you’ll see an option for Send Xodo Sign Agreement. Select this and in the new window that appears, choose which template to send, the Subject of your email, and the message you’d like to send with it. Click the Send Agreement button when ready.

After the individual receives and e-signs the documents, you’ll receive notice it was completed. Also, in the entity’s record, specifically the Communications section, you’ll see a notation for the sent Xodo Sign document, as well as a button to download the agreement.

Why can’t I save the webhook URL in Xodo Sign?
----------

Ensure there are no white spaces at the beginning or end of the URL.

Make sure there are no capital letters in your URL.

# WHAT IS THE MAILCHIMP INTEGRATION AND HOW DO I ADD IT

What Is the Mailchimp Integration and How Do I Add It?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

Mailchimp is a broadcast email tool allowing you to send communications en masse to large numbers of individuals. The Mailchimp integration in ISP allows you to automatically create and update a Mailchimp audience based on the contacts in your database. From Mailchimp, you can also choose between mailing to your entire database or audience segments based on saved searches.

Please note that Mailchimp accounts are created with different pricing plans, including a free plan. Each plan comes with its own limited number of allowable Audiences. The free plan allows only ONE Audience. You may need to delete your audience if you created one prior to setting up this integration. The integration will not work if you have already reached your limit of used Audiences in Mailchimp, regardless of the pricing plan you are on.

### How do I add the Mailchimp integration? ###

Navigate to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove Integrations. On the resulting page, scroll down to the Available integrations and click on Mailchimp. You’ll then see a window appear with required account and committee information, as well as options for adding specific messaging.

Fill out all the required fields marked with an asterisk and click Add Integration. You’ll then be automatically redirected to the Mailchimp login screen and asked to log into your Mailchimp account.

Please keep in mind this integration requires you to have an existing Mailchimp account. If you do not already have a Mailchimp account prior to adding this integration, you will need to remove and re-add this integration after you have created the Mailchimp account.

After you log in, you’ll be automatically redirected back to your database. At this point your integration has been installed and you should see a new Mailchimp menu option under Integrations.

### How does it work? ###

Only the primary email on individual records in ISP are synced with your new audience in Mailchimp. This process can take some time, approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Vendors and other organizations with emails will remain only in ISP. With this integration, your Saved Searches in Advanced Search will automatically be created as Tags in Mailchimp. This means if you create a custom Saved Search in ISP to narrow your list down further, that will become a Tag you can use in Mailchimp. There are also a few default tags that are part of the Quick List in ISP that will become Tags too. To view those lists in Mailchimp, click the Tag option on the left hand sidebar. You can use Tags in Mailchimp to keep them organized based on your Advanced Searches and contact only those in that specific Tag via Mailchimp.

If you make updates to Individual records in your database and the changes have a direct impact on contacts in Mailchimp, those changes will happen overnight and be reflected in Mailchimp the next day. You can also force it to sync by navigating to the Mailchimp page under the Integrations tab and clicking the Force Sync button at the bottom of the screen if you need it urgently. Again, this can take 5 to 10 minutes to sync.

Make sure you don’t add data directly into the ISP Audience in Mailchimp! Any data added that way will be overwritten when data from ISP is synced. Any individual records in ISP that are made inactive are not included in the Mailchimp sync. If an individual record has its email deleted, it will also be removed from the Mailchimp sync.

Currently, data only goes from ISP to Mailchimp as part of this integration. More features are planned and we will update this page as they go live.

### Why should I use Mailchimp? ###

Over time we’ve heard from a number of clients that using other services besides Mailchimp results in a large number of emails ending up in Spam or not delivered at all. So while Mailchimp has a cost for larger volumes of data, the increased deliverability has proven to be worth the cost and satisfaction of clients using it for their email communications and lists.

For more help with Mailchimp, please view their [help file system](https://mailchimp.com/help/).

### Troubleshooting ###

### If you’ve set up the Mailchimp integration and still are not seeing contacts in Mailchimp, you may need to resync. Click Integrations and then Mailchimp to navigate to the Mailchimp integration page. At the bottom left of that screen, press Resync.

# HOW DO I ADD CANDIDATE AND COMMITTEE RECORDS DIRECTLY FROM THE FEC

How Do I Add Candidate and Committee Records Directly From the FEC?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

In ISP you have the ability to add both a Committee and Candidate record to your database directly from the FEC site when using the Search option at the top of the screen. The information that gets imported in will include key pieces of data, such as address, ID number, and other financial information.

First, if you haven’t yet, enable the FEC Search feature by navigating to the System tab, then to Account Management. On the resulting screen, locate the Account Preferences section and toggle on the option to include the data in searches.

After this feature has been enabled, when searching for committee records that are not in your database, you’ll see the name you were searching for and a message allowing you to import from FEC data.

Clicking this will automatically add the record to your database and add any pertinent information required for filing and standard information purposes.

On the Organization search page under the Add/Search tab, you’ll also see an option to Exclude matches from FEC data. This will help you limit the results on your screen.

# HOW DO I ENTER A NON TRAVEL ADVANCE OF PERSONAL FUNDS

How Do I Enter a Non-Travel Advance of Personal Funds?
==========

During a campaign, an individual sometimes uses their personal funds or personal credit to pay a vendor for a committee expense and is later reimbursed by the committee. This is called an Advance of Personal Funds.

There are different rules depending if it is for [Travel](https://ispolitical.com/How-do-I-report-Advances-for-Travel/) or Non-Travel Advance. Please note the rules for a Travel Advance of Personal Funds only applies to the FEC. This help file will cover Non-Travel Advances.

**Non-Travel Advance Made and Reimbursed in the Same Period:**

* Enter the reimbursement to the individual as an Expense, with the vendors paid as Splits
* If the advance was not fully reimbursed, create the difference as an Accrued Expense Balance Reduction with the Tag: Forgiven

**Non-Travel Advance Made But Not Reimbursed in the Same Period:**

* Enter the reimbursement to the individual as an Accrued Expense, with the vendors paid as splits
* When the individual is reimbursed, record this as an Accrued Expense Payment

# DEALING WITH SPAM FILTERS

Dealing with SPAM Filters
==========

There is no hard fast rule on what results in when email goes into spam or into the inbox. However, below are some insights or possible contributing factors.

1. Make sure to mark it as not spam. The more people that do that, the higher the likelihood of future email being delivered.

2. If it is your first broadcast email, you don’t have a reputation yet, and that can lower the numbers. Even though the email is being sent out on a highly reputable email server, the email associated with the broadcast is not known. As you send out more broadcast emails, the combination of a reputable email server and reputable email will increase deliverability.

3. Many email servers will hold onto batches of emails from an unknown email source for a short time (typically up to 24 hours) before delivering them if they think there might be more coming. This is so they can determine if it is spam or not.

4. Some email servers route all group broadcasts into spam if the algorithms they use sees something in the content common to large broadcast emails regardless of the source.

5. Depending on the day and time an email is sent, it could take longer for it to “settle out” into the true numbers. Usually waiting 24 hours to make sure any bounces or server holds are resolved is a good idea before taking further action.

If after 24 hours you are not seeing an improvement (or a high bounce rate), you can request we resend the broadcast to only those emails that did not send a read response back. Most email servers send that response back to the sender, so this is a very useful way to increase deliverability for initial broadcast.

# ABOUT THE TX COH REPORT

About the TX COH Report
==========

Applies To: Texas

The TX COH (Candidate/Officeholder) form is used to file reports under the regular filing schedule and is used for the following reports.

Report Periods
----------

* **January 15 Report**: All candidates and most officeholders must file a semiannual report by January 15.
* **July 15th Report**: This report covers January 1st or the day after the deadline of the last required report. The end date is June 30th.
* **30th Day Before Election Report**: Opposed candidates in an election who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this pre-election report. If an opposed candidate chose modified reporting, but then exceeded a threshold before the 30th day before the election, the candidate must file this report.
* **8th Day Before Election Report**: Opposed candidates in an election who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this pre-election report. If an opposed candidate chose modified reporting but then exceeded a threshold before the 8th day before the election, the candidate must file this report.
* **Runoff Report**: Opposed candidates who are participating in a runoff election and who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this runoff report. The report is due no later than 8 days before the runoff election.
* **Exceeded Modified Reporting Limit Report**: Candidates who chose to file under the modified reporting schedule but then, after the 30th day before the election, exceeded $940 in contributions or $940 in expenditures in connection with the election must file this Exceeded Modified Reporting Limit report within 48 hours after exceeding the $940 limit.
* **15th Day After Campaign Treasurer Appointment Report (Officeholders Only):** An officeholder must file this report if he or she appoints a campaign treasurer after a period of not having a campaign treasurer appointment (Form CTA) on file.
* **Final Report:** A person who has a campaign treasurer appointment on file may file this report when he or she does not expect to accept any further campaign contributions or make or authorize any further campaign expenditures. There is no fixed deadline for this report.

**Schedule F4** (Expenditures Made By Credit Card): if you use credit cards to charge campaign expenditures, then the whole transaction should have Reporting Code CREDITCARD, and that will ensure that the splits will pull to the Sch F4.

To file your report, you must generate and download your e-file to upload to your filing account. Texas requires your e-file to be in .csv format. Log into your state account and file your report with the state.

# CAN I FILE A REPORT IF I DON T HAVE A FPPC ID YET

Can I File a Report if I Don’t Have a FPPC ID Yet?
==========

Applies To: California

Sometimes you may be ready to file your local CA report but have yet to receive your FPPC ID. In this case, we recommend the following.

First, contact your local agency to determine if you can file with a paper report. They will have guidance on what they can and can not accept as far as filing a report without a FPPC ID.

We also suggest emailing and/or calling to determine the status of the FPPC ID and when that process will be complete. You can use the following contact information:

# WHAT IS BANK STATEMENT RECONCILIATION HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Bank Statement Reconciliation & How Do I Use It?
==========

The Reconciliation feature in ISP allows you to accurately keep track of your finances outside of ISP and ensure all transactions are financially accounted for and match your actual bank statement.

If it is your first time doing a reconciliation or you are starting a new one, you will see four bank statement fields:

* **Account:** The financial account to reconcile. Reconciliation is done on a financial account-by-financial account basis and is independent of the filers. Only transactions that are part of the specific financial account you select will appear.
* **Closing Date:** The ending date of the bank statement you are reconciling. Along with the financial account selected, only transactions equal to and older than this date will appear.
* **Starting Balance:** The starting balance of the bank statement for that month. If there was prior activity in the account that is not in ISP, that is factored into the number entered here.
* **Ending Balance:** The ending balance as indicated on the bank statement you are reconciling.

Once completed, click the Generate button to calculate the difference between the starting and ending balance and pull any transactions older than the Closing date entered.

On the new screen, the Statement Summary section will display the info you added, totals for Receipts and Disbursements, and the Difference between your previously entered Starting and Ending balances. As Outstanding Transactions are selected, the totals and Difference amount will automatically adjust. To adjust the information you previously entered, click the Edit Statement Details button.

The overall goal with reconciliation is to get the difference between the starting and ending balances to be $0. That indicates all transactions affecting the actual bank statement have been identified. The system will not allow a reconciliation to be applied until the Difference shows $0, at which point the Reconcile button will appear at the bottom of the screen. Until then, this button will not show.

If during this process you catch anything missing, click Continue Later at the bottom of the screen to save the work you’ve done up to that point, and leave the page to make corrections.

If your starting balance doesn’t match what was previously marked as cleared, review transactions that may have been edited since your last reconciliation. To view these transactions, click the Changed Reconciled Transactions Report link in the message.

If you have the Dropbox integration installed in your database, you’ll see the Dropbox icon in various spots when reconciling a bank statement. Use this folder to add attachments to the specific reconciliation you are working in, whether it’s a current reconciliation or you’re reviewing a previously completed reconciliation. Each reconciliation statement will have its own room for attachments specific to only that reconciliation statement.

Along with the Reconcile and Continue Later buttons at the bottom of the screen is a Past Reconciliations drop-up menu, which allows you to view past reconciliations, as well as reopen or undo the most recent reconciliation. This latter option is good for correcting previous reconciliation mistakes.

For financial accounts that have over 200 transactions that are yet to be reconciled and it has been over six months since the last dated reconciliation, you will see an option to Auto Reconcile all historical transactions. This option only appears when both criteria have been met.

How do I handle adding, editing, or deleting a transaction that had previously been reconciled?
----------

Best practices are to undo reconciliations back to the relevant month, correct the transaction error, and redo the reconciliations going forward.

However, if you choose, you can include an old transaction in the current reconciliation. The reconciliation system only requires that the ending balance be $0. It will warn you if the starting balance doesn’t match but it will not prevent you from completing your reconciliation.

# HOW DO I BATCH PRINT CHECKS

How Do I Batch Print Checks?
==========

If you handle multiple accounts and have checks to print, you can print them in batches using cross-account check printing. However, prior to printing, please be sure you are using MICR ink. This stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition and is needed to correctly print specific numbers on the check, such as Account Number, Routing Number, and more.

When searching for checks to print, use the Settings section to determine the starting Check Number for each account you handle. This will be determined by the Check Number used when the expense was created.

In the Settings section is also a drop down menu for Check Format. There are various formats to choose from, though they will all print in three-part checks; one for the receipt, one for the check, and one for your own records. Each format allows for either a pre-lined check or a simple blank check to fill in.

The section below Settings is where you’ll find all available checks to print. Listed will be the Account Name, Date, Amount, and Election. There is a column on the left with check boxes to choose the check, or you can select the box at the top of the column to select all transactions listed and print out all the checks.

When ready, click the Print Checks button at the bottom of the screen to create the check(s).

# WHAT IS THE PASSWORD SAFE

What Is the Password Safe?
==========

The security of passwords is very important no matter what the password is used for. In ISP, we have created Password Safe, a place where in the system your filing password is kept protected and ready for use the next time you need to file a report.

After you have generated your report and are ready to file, click the Efile button. On the resulting page will either be fields to add your password and an option to add it to the Password Safe, or, if Password Safe has been used in the past, you’ll see a message stating Password Safe is in use.

If you have used Password Safe in the past but need to change the password in Password Safe, generate the report as normal and again click Efile. On the resulting screen, you’ll see a Change Password link. Click this to update to the new password for future use.

# WHAT ARE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES TO KEEP IN MIND

What Are Accounting Practices to Keep In Mind?
==========

If your background does not include extensive experience in accounting, the learning curve can sometimes be pretty steep. In this help file, we want to share some of the basics when it comes to accounting both here in ISP and beyond.

First, while there are plenty of different transaction types, the most commonly used transactions are Monetary Contributions and Expenses, and each transaction will have a cash impact.

For example, Monetary Contributions and Other Income transactions increase cash, while Expenses decrease cash.

There are also some transactions, such as Inkind Contributions, that have no impact on cash. The reason is they are considered a gift of something rather than money.

Sometime you want to enter the exact opposite of a transaction, such as a reversed Monetary Contribution. A reversed Monetary Contribution is a lot like an expense, as its purpose is to decrease to cash. These are created by checking the Is Reversal box at the top of the transaction details.

So if reversed contributions reduce cash and so do expenses, what’s the difference? It is a subtle one and mostly has to do with properly understanding, as well as reporting, your finances.

With a campaign, or a business, you have your income and you have your expenses. A reversed contribution is a decrease in income rather than an expense. The most common situation would be a bounced check.

**Best Practices**

When adding contributions to the system prior to batching them into deposits, it helps to add them to the Undeposited area, then batch them according to when they were deposited into your bank account, as opposed to adding each transaction to the Register and batching them after the fact. This also will allow for a smoother reconciliation process.

It’s also a useful practice to add transactions to the database as soon as you can. This allows the AI feature to warn you of any potential issues with your transactions you may have missed when adding them. When it comes to reporting, the last thing you’ll want to deal with are issues on a deadline.

**Bookkeeping**

Bookkeeping is essentially a way of recognizing there’s an accounting mistake somewhere but you don’t have the time to figure out exactly what so in the meantime, in order to temporarily get totals correct, you’ll enter a correcting transaction instead.

Please note we don’t recommend this but we understand sometimes it’s necessary.

Once you have filed your report or handled any other tasks that required the Bookkeeping transaction, be sure to go back and determine the cause of the discrepancy, then remove the Bookkeeping transaction.

**Cash vs. Net Worth**

You may see these two terms in the system: Cash on Hand and Net Worth. While they have some similarities in specifics, the biggest difference between the two is that Cash on Hand is the actual amount of money you have in the bank, and Net Worth is the cash you have MINUS any outstanding debt you may have, such as loans or accrued expenses.

You can generate a report of Cash vs Net Worth on the Compliance Tools page under the Reporting tab.

# ABOUT THE NY CF 7 AUTHORIZED USER DESIGNATION AND REMOVAL FORM

About the NY Cf-07 (Authorized User Designation and Removal Form)
==========

Applies To: New York

The New York State Board of Elections requires all filers to use the web-based application for financial disclosure reporting.

The [Authorized User Designation and Removal Form](https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/download/finance/cf07.pdf) is filed by treasurers to designate authorized users or remove users for the New York’s filing.

NYSBOE permits a treasurer to designate additional authorized users who can access the filer’s EFS Web Application account. Each authorized user will have a different email address and password login than the treasurer has. Authorized users will be able to login into the committee’s account, create report drafts, and add/delete/edit transactions. Authorized users will not be able to submit any reports, as responsbility goes to the treasurer of the committee.

All of New York’s authorization forms are not e-fillable. The CF-07 must contain an original signature in ink, then mailed to:

NYS Board of Elections

# WHAT IS THE REGISTER

What Is the Register?
==========

The Register is a chronological list of financial transactions and running bank balance total. Here you can track incoming and outgoing transactions, as well as perform various tasks with them.

If you have multiple accounts, you can view transactions associated only with that Filer/Account, or view all transactions no matter the Filer/Account. Use the dropdown menu to select the register you’d like to view.

To the left of each transaction is a red X. This allows you to delete the transaction, if desired. On the right side are three stacked dots, also known as the hot dog menu. Clicking this provides options available to edit the transaction. These options are based on the transaction type.

If you delete or change amount details of a transaction, the data in the Balance column above the transaction you edited will be blurred out. You will then see a recycle icon, which will refresh the Register to update the new balance and column totals.

At the bottom of the screen are the following buttons:

### Add Transaction ###

Clicking this allows you to add a new transaction of any type.

### Undeposited Funds ###

This screen will be where all the transactions that have yet to be deposited live. The number listed is the total amount of transactions waiting to be deposited.

### Balances ###

If you have transactions that carry a debt, such as a Loan or Accrued Expense, this page will show those transactions.

### Go To Non-Monetary Transactions ###

Non-Monetary transactions consist of In-Kind contributions, Support/Oppose memos, and other transactions with no cash impact.

# WHAT IS AN ANONYMOUS TRANSACTION AND HOW DO I ADD ONE

What Is an Anonymous Transaction and How Do I Add One?
==========

If you have a large amount of small transactions that would not be itemized regardless, you can create an Anonymous transaction in the sum total of all the transactions instead of having to create a new record for each transaction.

Generally speaking, the only current Anonymous transactions supported are Monetary Contribution and Expense.

On compliance reports, our system is built to ensure they are attributed to the Other Entity record called Anonymous and remain unitemized.

How Do I Add an Anonymous Transaction?
----------

Under the Lists tab, click Other Entities. On the resulting page, if you do not see Anonymous showing in the Name section, click Add Other Entity at the bottom of the screen and add one.

When you have added Anonymous and/or you are ready to add the transaction, click on Anonymous. You’ll be directed to a page where you can add the transaction. Click the add plus sign in the right hand corner of the Transactions Section and add the details of your transaction.

Please be aware that not all agencies support Anonymous transactions on compliance reports. Below is a list of states that support or don’t support Anonymous transactions.

**Anonymous Contributions**

Supported: AL, AZ, CA, FEC, IN, IRS, KS, ME, NH, WA, WY

Not Supported:
– Anonymous Contributions Prohibited by State: CT, GA, IL, MI, NC, OR, PA, TX, VA, WV
– Report Itemizes All Contributions: FL, MT, OH, VT
– Has Specific Rules Regarding Anonymous Contributions: CO, IA, LA, MN, MO, NJ, NM, NY, WI

**Anonymous Expenses**

Supported: AL, CO, FEC, GA, IA, IL, IN, IRS, KS, MO, MS, PA, TX

Not Supported:
– Report Itemizes All Expenses: CT, FL, LA, ME, MT, NH, NJ, OH, OR, VA, VT, WV
– Not Currently Supported: AZ, CA, MN, NM, NY, WY

**Note About PA Anonymous Contributions**

To disclose transactions under $10 with no contact information, associate the transactions with the Other Entity Anonymous. This will ensure the transactions are unitemized.

# WHAT IS AI ISP IN CONSULTANT TOOLS

What Is ai@ISP in Consultant Tools?
==========

The ai@ISP page for Consultants shows the AI settings for each account you manage.

When you first land on this page, you’ll see a list of your accounts on the left side. The next column to the right is the Settings column. Here you can edit different settings for AI performed tasks. These will include options like Combine Duplicates, Mark Reports as Filed, and more.

To turn a particular Setting On or Off for all of your accounts, you can click the My Other Accounts button at the bottom of the page.  From this button’s drop-up menu, select Enable On All Accounts. You will see the change reflected in the Settings column for each account.

In the middle column you’ll also see a link for customizing an Employer/Occupation email that AI can send out. This gives you the ability to create an email requesting Employer and/or Occupation info from entities that are missing that info from their records.

On the right is column for Recipients. Here you can determine which user on staff will receive AI alerts for that database.

# HOW DO I COMBINE DUPLICATES IN SEARCH RESULTS

How Do I Combine Duplicates in Search Results?
==========

In ISP, there are a few ways of combining duplicate records. One handy way is right there on the Individual or Organization search screen.

First, under the Add/Search tab, select Individuals or Organizations, depending on who you’ll be searching for and potentially combining. Be sure to search for, at the very least, a part of the name that will be in both records. For example, if you are looking for Abraham Lincoln and want to combine it with the Abe Lincoln record, search only for the last name, Lincoln. If the name is not something you can match on, use other options, such as Address or Email, to locate the two potential duplicate records.

Once you’ve found the records you intend to merge, click on the hotdog menu to the right of the name of the record you intend to keep, then select Combine Duplicate. Be aware that the first record you select will be the one that will keep its name.

After clicking Combine Duplicate, you’ll then see a Combine button appear for each of the records in your search. Locate the second record you want to combine with the first and click Combine. The second record will be merged into the first record you selected.

If there are more than a few duplicates you need to combine or if you just want to check for potential ones, we also have the [Combine Duplicates tool under the Tools tab](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-combine-duplicates/).

# HOW DO I SET UP A NATIONBUILDER INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up a NationBuilder Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

The NationBuilder integration allows you to import donation data entered on your NationBuilder site directly into your ISP database. This integration pulls data from NationBuilder with dates in the last two weeks. If there are transactions entered into NationBuilder older than two weeks, they will need to be manually imported separately.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from NationBuilder via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, NationBuilder will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

### How do I add the NationBuilder integration to my database? ###

1. Under the Integrations tab, click Add/Remove Integrations.

2. On the resulting screen, scroll until you see NationBuilder in the Available section, then click it.

3. In the window that appears requesting Slug information, enter your NationBuilder account name. You can find this by going to your NationBuilder site and looking at the website name. For example: If your NationBuilder website was johnson.nation.builder.com, you would enter Johnson as the Slug.

4. After you’ve added the Slug, click Add Integration. You will be automatically redirected to the NationBuilder site for verification and approvals on their end. You will be prompted to sign in if you’re not already signed into your NationBuilder account. After signing in, click Authorize.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a NationBuilder organization record in your ISP database with NationBuilder’s details.

When data is transferred from NationBuilder to ISP, you can find it in the [Pending Imports](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) section of your Dashboard.

Please note the following:

* NationBuilder integration supports In-Kinds. The transaction must have a tracking code in NationBuilder of IN-KIND or INKIND to be distinguished from regular contributions.
* Recurring Donations: When new donations are processed, we pull that data from NationBuilder via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, NationBuilder will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the info we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.
* There is up to a 30 minute delay for incoming donations to fully process into the ISP system.

# WHAT ARE CAREY COMMITTEES AND CAREY ACCOUNTS

What Are Carey Committees and Carey Accounts?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

A Carey Committee, sometimes known as a hybrid PAC, is a committee that can make Independent Expenditures in unlimited amounts but still has limits on money they can give directly to other campaigns and committees. Carey Committees are required to maintain separate bank accounts for the two types of expenditures.

ISP’s Carey Account tool allows you to handle the tracking and appropriate reporting for this separate account.

If your PAC is a hybrid/Carey Committee, add the Carey Account tool via the Add/Remove Tools option under the Tools tab.

To ensure the correct Financial Account in ISP is used for Carey transactions, go to the Financial Accounts option under the Lists tab. On the resulting page, click the name of the account used for Carey transactions and click the Carey Non-Contribution option. This option is also available when creating new Financial Accounts.

Transactions associated with this account will pull to the appropriate lines on the FEC Form 3X.

In-Kind Contributions associated with Carey accounts are supported but require a bit of additional data entry. If you want In-Kind want to pull as a Carey In-Kind, add the tag Carey In-Kind to each transaction.

# HOW DO I CREATE TRANSACTIONS CONSIDERED DEBT

How Do I Create Transactions Considered Debt?
==========

When working in a campaign, accruing debts is inescapable. In ISP, depending on the type of debt, there are two ways you can reflect debt: Accrued Expenses and Loan Received.

### Accrued Expenses ###

These transactions are when you owe an entity, whether it’s an individual or organization, for a product or service. Accrued Expense transactions are created like any other transaction, either in the Transactions section of the record or via the Register. These transactions will carry a balance with them until a payment is made. To view them, navigate to the Balances page under the Accounting tab. You also have the ability to [lower or pay off the debt](https://ispolitical.com/how-to-add-a-full-or-partial-payment-to-an-accrued-expense/).

### Loan Received ###

A Loan Received transaction carries a debt owed to an entity based on money you received from them. This debt remains until a payment is made or it is forgiven. To create a Loan Received transaction, use the standard process of either adding through the Transactions section in a record or via the Register. Similar to Accrued Expenses, you also have the ability to [make a repayment or reduction](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-loan-repayment-or-forgiveness/) on the loan.

# WHAT DOES THIS CA EFILE SYSTEM RETURN MESSAGE MEAN

What Does This CA Efile System Return Message Mean?
==========

Applies To: California

After you efile a CA report from ISP, you may get a system return message that is confusing.

Here’s what these messages could mean:

1) Status: the job failed to process
This message is likely because you attempted to file the report to local instead of filing to the state. Regenerate your report and select Efile Report instead of Efile Report to Local

# HOW DO I SET UP THE ANEDOT INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up the Anedot Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

Anedot is a donation platform that provides tools to raise more money including one click Instant Donations, customizable recurring options, post-donation upsells, donor recovery, and more. When integrated with ISP, you’ll be able to receive donor data and information quickly.

How do I set up the Anedot Integration?
----------

Setting up the Anedot integration in ISP happens in two stages, first within ISP, then the process is completed in your Anedot account.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Anedot via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Anedot will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t allow for any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

In ISP:

1. Under the Integrations tab, click Add/Remove Integrations.
2. On the resulting Integrations screen, you will see a list of existing integrations in two sections: Installed and Available.
3. Locate and click the Anedot integration in the Available section. It will then shift to the Installed section.

Next, in Anedot:

Log into your Anedot account and complete the process there. Anedot’s [help file](https://help.anedot.com/en/articles/9044458-ispolitical-isp) will walk you through the process on the Anedot site.

You will need your ISP Account Name to complete the integration on Anedot. Make sure to use your short account name (the name at the top left of your screen next to the text ISP).

Once you’ve completed the process in both ISP and Anedot, the integration will be set up. The system will now automatically create an Anedot organization record in the account with Anedot’s details and your donation data from Anedot will be automatically sent to your [Pending Imports](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) on your Dashboard.

You can control how your transactions come into ISP through the Auto-Import settings on the [ai@ISP page](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-ai-isp/).

How can I use Budget Category customization?
----------

The Customize Budget Category section on the Anedot Settings page allows you to determine which Budget Category is applied to a donation no matter the form used. You can use a Budget Category already in your database or select the Create children of default category Unmapped option to create new Budget Categories that match the source codes ISP receives from Anedot. This allows for using a generic main Budget Category, e.g., Anedot Donations, while capturing some nuance of different Anedot Pages.

You can also set up Anedot forms in ISP to map to Budget Categories. In the Per Form Categories section on the Anedot Settings page, add the Form Name and the Budget Category to be associated with the transactions that come in via this specific form. Please note that the Form Name must be a written name, as opposed to the URL for the form. This Per Form Categories setup will ensure that Anedot donations map automatically to the chosen Budget Categories via the integration import.

How do I link a donation page?
----------

Navigate to the Integrations tab and click the Anedot option. This page will inform you if the Anedot integration has been enabled, as well as if transactions have been received. If so, you’ll also see a count of how many have been received since the first Anedot transfer.

Below the integration status and transaction count is Account UID. This allows you to link your Anedot donation page. The easiest way to locate your UID is to take it from the URL address while in your Anedot account and on the Dashboard. It will be a string of letters and numbers and will always begin with the letter a.

Once the UID has been added and your donation page linked, you’ll be able to add donations directly through ISP. This option will be found in two locations: Individual Search Results and Add Transaction.

In Individual Search Results, after a search is performed and the results appear, click the hot dog menu and select Enter Credit Card: Anedot Individual Record Details: When in the record, click the Add button at the bottom of the screen and select Enter Credit Card: Anedot.

When the link opens, the entity’s basic contact info will auto-populate and you’ll see fields to enter in donation information. The donation will be processed by Anedot and come into ISP via the regular integration method.

Please note that linking another PAC as a conduit is currently not supported by ISP. In this instance, contributions will either need to be manually entered or imported via the Quick Imports tool.

Campaign vs Action Pages
----------

Anedot has two different types of integration pages: Action Pages and Campaign.

As for functionality, Action Pages will contain more. However, we have no preference as to which one is used, as both integrate with ISP. You can use either or both. To be safe, we do suggest turning both integration options on.

Please note only Campaign Pages have a Push Unsent Donations option, which will push any historical data over to ISP.

Troubleshooting Problems
----------

Below are some common problems you may encounter.

1. My donors are coming through but not the Occupation/Employer information: In Anedot, there are ways to set up Custom Fields for the form. However, if there are issues with the set up, it can cause information to not be sent over to ISP. Fortunately, Anedot also has built in Occupation/Employer fields for forms. If you used Custom Fields for Occupation/Employer and this info is not coming over to ISP, remove the Custom Fields from the form and use the Anedot-built fields instead.
2. I’m getting duplicate transactions from Anedot: It’s possible there are two ISP connections in Anedot. This can cause items to come over twice. Access your Anedot account and review the connections, then delete the one not needed.

# ABOUT THE NM CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORT

About the NM Campaign Finance Report
==========

Applies To: New Mexico

The New Mexico Campaign Finance Report is a statement of your incoming, outgoing, and pending finances.

Please note that Compliance notes for Monetary Contributions are just reported as Monetary Contribution by default but will pull from the Compliance Note field if any note exists.

In regards to certain balances, which include credit cards:

* **Accrued Expenses:** Splits to Accrued Expenses are reported as the actual expenses. The state does not care that the expenses and corresponding payments were actually made using a credit card.
* **Loans:** Only the outstanding amount of the Accrued Expense will be listed as the loan. The payments made to the Accrued Expense will be listed as loan payments.

To file your report, download the generated file and upload it by logging in to the [New Mexico Campaign Finance System](https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index).

# WHY IS MY COMPLIANCE REPORT CASH ON HAND DIFFERENT FROM MY REGISTER CASH ON HAND

Why Is My Compliance Report Cash on Hand Different From My Register Cash on Hand?
==========

Sometimes you may notice your Cash On Hand total on the compliance report is different from the total in your register. A common reason is a transaction remains undeposited. However, the most common reason is that a transaction was deposited after the close of the reporting period. In this case, the explanation for the transaction’s inclusion on the Cash vs Bank Balance report would appear in the report results as Deposited after the date but received before.

To help determine the specific transactions creating this difference, use the Cash vs Bank Balance report on the Compliance Tools page under the Report tab. Select the Cash vs Bank Balance from the Report field drop-down menu, add the date in the Date field, then click the Submit button.

Along with the reason for including the transaction on the Cash vs Bank Balance report, report results will include the transaction date, the entity associated with the transaction, and the transaction amount. They will also include your Cash On Hand total and Bank Balance total.

# WHAT IS FORM BUILDER HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Form Builder & How Do I Use It?
==========

Form Builder is where you can create forms for various volunteer or similar purposes. These form pages, when used, will send the data to the Pending Imports section on your Dashboard to import the volunteers as new entity records.

To begin, be sure the Form Builder tool has been added to your database. If you do not see it under the Tools tab, select Add/Remove Tools. On the resulting page, either use the search field to search for Form Builder or scroll down until you see it. When you see it, click it to add it to your database. Once it has been successfully added, you should see it under the Tools tab.

Once you arrive on the Form Builder page, you will see any existing Form Pages. If there aren’t any, you’ll need to add one. At the bottom of the screen are several buttons to get started.

**Add Form Page:** This will open up a small window where you will create the basic details of the Form Page.

**Form Emails:** This will redirect you to a connected page where you can create a confirmation email if the Form Page you are creating is a sign-up or donation page.

**Print:** This is a standard print option that will print the basic details of the Form Pages showing.

The Confirmation Email is optional so it is not necessary to create that first. However, if you do want to add a Confirmation Email to your Form Page, click the Form Emails button. On the resulting page, click the Add Form Email button at the bottom of the screen. In the small window that appears, you’ll have the ability to fully create an email to automatically send back to the individual who used the Form Page.

In the Text field, you can create the message you want to send using standard text options. There is also a Merge Fields option which instructs the system to automatically insert information into the email for you. This includes Full Name, First Name, and Amount information.

Once you complete the required fields, click the Add button to create the Form Email to add to your Form Page. To return to the Form Pages screen, click the Manage Pages button at the bottom.

Back on the Form Pages screen, click Add Form Page to create the basic details of the Form Page. In the small window that appears, complete the fields with the applicable information. The last option, Confirmation Email, will be a dropdown menu containing the Form Emails you just created or have created in the past. Once you’ve finished making selections and filling out fields, click the Add button.

On the main Form Pages screen, you’ll now see the page you created with various columns and new options.

**Title:** If you need to make any edits to the basic information of the Form Page, click the name to open the window and make changes.

**Form Page:** The Form Page link is what you will use to embed the Form Page into your website. You can copy and paste that link into the applicable location on your website.

**Flags:** If you’d like existing Flags in your database to be added to the Form Page user’s record, click the [Add] option and select the Flags you’d like to incorporate into the page. In the small window that appears, select the Flag from the dropdown. If you’d like the system to automatically add the Flag, select the Always Added option. Otherwise, select Checkbox if you’d like to give the Form Page user the choice.

**Display:** Here you can choose how the Form Page displays to the Form Page user and also how confirmation text appears.

* **Upload Logo:** When you click the Upload Logo button, a small window will appear where you can select an image from your computer. Please note the recommended image size is approximately 3.5 times wider than it is tall.
* **Customize Confirmation Text:** Here you can determine the message that appears on the screen after a successful use of the Form Page. This is different than the Form Email, as this is only displayed on the screen, not emailed to them.
* **Other Options:** If you are familiar with Css code or Google Analytics, you can use that to enhance the page and track its use.

Once you have completed all of the above, your Form Page is now ready for use.

# HOW DO I SET THE FLAG ICON

How Do I Set the Flag Icon?
==========

Using Flag Icons is a way of visually expressing the Flag associated with a record. When choosing the icon, you’ll be able to view a vast amount of symbols and images that best describe the chosen Flag.

On the Flags page, in the Icon column, click [Set] for the Flag you’d like to add the icon for. On the resulting screen, type in a key word that is or describes the flag you are attempting to set, then click the magnifying glass to search.

For example, if you have a Lives In California flag, you could type in the word California and images will appear for you to choose from.

Once you click the image, the next screen will allow you to change the color of the icon, if you choose. At the bottom of the screen, click Change Color and select the color you’d like to see used for the icon.

When ready, click Set For Flag to set the icon as the symbol for that particular Flag. This will place you back on the Flags screen where you can verify the icon has been added to the Flag.

When viewing records, you’ll also see this icon in the Flags section if this particular Flag has been added to the record.

# WHAT ARE THE AVAILABLE QUICK IMPORT FORMATS IN ISP

What Are the Available Quick Import Formats in ISP?
==========

When your ISP database is first created, it comes with standard default Quick Import formats. Others are available to add, so if you don’t see the one you’re looking for, please contact Support.

Each of the Quick Imports below come with a downloadable template to use if you plan on using that import more than once. These are found in the sidebar of the screen for each Quick Import. The ai Assisted does not have a template to download. When completing the template, be sure not to rearrange columns on the spreadsheet, as this can negatively affect the import.

**ai Assisted:** If the other import formats do not apply to what you need to import, use this option. There are no set columns or order.

Please note that you cannot use this format for conduit contributions.

**Caged Donations:** This import template can be used if the import contains transactions that happened via different methods, such as Cash or Credit Card or Check or otherwise. Selecting a specific Financial Account besides Undeposited will deposit all transactions on the spreadsheet into one Deposit.

**Check from Conduit:** Use this import template if you need to import transactions sent to you on one single check from a conduit. You can also use this import to add JFC contributions and memos. However, after the import completes, you’ll have to go into each transaction and change the Tag from Conduit Check to Transfer.

**Communications:** The Communications import allows you to add a Communication Type to an existing or new record. If the import contains a Communication has not been created in your database, you will have the option to allow the system create it for you upon import.

**Contacts:** This import quickly imports individuals and their contact information, as well as Flags, if applicable.

**Credit Card Statement:** This import will create a single expense transaction to a specific Vendor. If the transaction is an expense not fully billed for, select the Add As Accrued Expense box during the import process.

**Expenses & Subvendors:** Using the Expenses & Subvendors import, you can bring in expense transactions and any subvendors and splits attached to the expenses.

**Flags:** Use this import in conjunction with record ID numbers to add a Flag to the record. To locate the record ID, navigate to the entity’s record and in the URL at the top of the screen, note the numbers at the end of the URL. This is the record ID for the entity’s record you are currently in.

**Individuals & Organizations:** This import allows you to add Individuals and Organizations, as well as contact information and any Flags you want associated with that entity.

**Inkind Contributions:** Inkind contributions have no cash impact. However, use this import to quickly add any Inkind contributions and the entity’s they’re attached to.

**Online Donations:** If you receive donations online, you can use this import template to import them into your database so it matches your bank statement.

**Organizations & Contributions:** If you have contributions and other Organizations you need to add to your database, use this template to bring that data in.

**Other Transactions:** This import lets you import transactions by transaction type.

**Targets and Pledges:** This import template allows you to import Targets and Pledges, as well as the entity they’re associated with. It will automatically create the Target or Pledge in that entity’s record.

As mentioned previously, if you don’t see a template here that will work for the data you want to import, please contact Support.

**Transfer of Contributions:** This import template allows you to bring in transactions from a conduit. This will add the tag Transfer to the main transaction.

# WHAT IS TIME TRACKING

What Is Time Tracking?
==========

Time Tracking allows you to stay up to date on how staff and volunteers are spending their time in the campaign.

To start, you’ll first need to create [Time Tracking Categories](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-Time-Tracking-Categories/). This option is found under the Tools tab. However, if you do not see the Time Tracking Categories option, please contact Support to get it added to your database.

Time Tracking Categories are used to specify how the time is being spent. An example would be Door to Door. If you have a volunteer going door to door and you want to know the date and times the volunteer was out in the area, you can use this Time Tracking Category.

After you have created the needed Time Tracking Categories, next create individual records for staff and/or volunteers, if this has not been completed already. Then, when in the record itself, you’ll see a Time Tracking section below the Transactions section.

To add a Time Tracking notation to the record, click the green triangle in the top right corner of the Time Tracking section. In the window that appears, add the applicable information.

**Category:** This will be a dropdown of options based of the items on the Time Tracking Categories page.
**Start:** This is the beginning date and time of the reason for tracking time.
**End:** This is the end date and time of the reason for tracking time.
**Notes:** Add any notes to the time tracking notation to be more specific.

When ready, click the Add Time Tracking button to add the notation to the record.

# WHAT IS THE 0 FEDERAL ALLOCATION USED FOR

What Is the 0% Federal Allocation Used For?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

This “allocation” is to be used by Joint State/Federal Filers for expenses paid with federal funds on behalf of the State Filer for 100% state-related activity.

It is not a true allocation – these transactions will not pull to any of the “H” schedules on the FEC Form 3x. Instead, the transactions will pull to Line 29 of the FEC Form 3x, with any Support/Oppose Memo information as appropriate.

In addition, the transactions will pull to Sch E of the CA Form 460 (with the corresponding Reporting Code) as a memo, with the Note for Compliance appended with “Paid with Federal Funds.”

If there is a Support/Oppose Memo associated with the transaction, that will pull to Sch D of the CA Form 460 and/or the CA Form 497 (as appropriate).

At this time, this allocation is not supported on any other reports – please contact support if you need this allocation supported on other reports.

### **How to Use the 0% Federal Allocation** ###

After logging into your database, go to Accounting \> Allocations.

At the bottom of the screen, you”ll see a button called “Add 0% Federal Allocation.”

Once you click on the “Add 0% Federal Allocation” button, the Allocation will automatically be added to your database. Because this allocation is not reported on any of the “H” schedules, you do not need to enter any of the additional information (name, start date or allocation ratio). In addition, this allocation will only appear once, and can be used over several years.

This allocation can be used on Expenses or Accrued Expenses, either with or without Support/Oppose Memos.

# WHAT IS THE WA AUCTION REPORT

What Is the WA Auction Report?
==========

Applies To: Washington

There are two parts to the WA Auction Report, entering in the item that is being auctioned and associating the buyer with the auctioned item.

To enter the item that is being auctioned, enter in an Inkind transaction from the donor. Be sure to:

* Put the item description in the Note for Compliance field
* Use the date of the auction rather than the date the item was donated
* Ensure there is a number in the Number field (this will pull to Item Number)
* Make sure you add the tag Auction to the Inkind contribution

When the item is purchased, click on the hot-dog menu next to the Inkind transaction in the Register, and select Add Item Purchase. The purchase amount up to the Fair Market Value amount of the donated item is considered Other Income. Any amount over the Inkind value is considered a contribution from the buyer

# HOW DO I FIND COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY DATE AND OR TYPE

How Do I Find Communications Made By Date and/or Type?
==========

In Advanced Search, you can find entity records based on Communications made on a specific date. Navigate to the Advanced Search option under the Add/Search tab to begin.

* **Relationship:** (choose if you want to use a specific date or a before/after date option)
* **Value:** (this dropdown provides various date options, including a custom date range option)

Click Add Rule

At this point, if you only needed a report of Communications made on a specific date but without specifying the communication type, click the Run Search button at the bottom of the screen. However, if you want to search on both the date and the communication type, use the next step to add to the Advanced Search recipe.

In the Add Rule section, leave the Area as Communication and select the following criteria for the remaining options:

* **Relationship:** Is Any Of (use Is Not Any Of if you want to exclude specific Communication Types)
* **Value:** (select one or more Communication Types from the dropdown)

Click Add Compound Rule. Note that this is different than the Add Rule button.

When ready, click the Run Search button at the bottom of the screen. If this is a report you expect to run on a regular basis, click the Save & Run Search button to both save the report criteria for future use and to generate the report.

# ABOUT GENERATING AND FILING COMPLIANCE REPORTS

About Generating and Filing Compliance Reports
==========

Where do I find Compliance reports in ISP?
----------

Under the Reports tab is a Compliance option. You’ll be taken to a report criteria screen when you select that. However, if the database was only recently set up, you may need to first [set the Filer](https://ispolitical.com/What-Records-are-Needed-for-Compliance-Reporting/). The Filer is your committee record in ISP and is then added as the Filer. Doing so informs the system of which Compliance reports your committee will be filing.

The criteria screen will determine the data that pulls to your Compliance report. It’s essential to make sure you are using the correct criteria, whether it’s the Report Dates or Previous Unitemized Individual Donations amount. The wrong information will again create mistakes that will prompt notice from the filing agency.

When you are satisfied with the criteria, click the Generate button. Messages at the top of the screen inform you of the report process status. When it finishes, you’ll land on a screen displaying either a message that no warnings and errors were found OR a list of warnings or errors you’ll need to correct before filing your report. Click the error or warning to display the area that needs correcting on the right side of the screen.

After you have corrected any issues, be sure to regenerate your report. This will allow your changes to be displayed correctly on the report.

To review the report, click the Download button at the bottom of the screen after the report is generated and select PDF. You can download the report anywhere on your computer and review it for any issues or concerns.

How do I e-file the Compliance report?
----------

After reviewing your report and being ready to e-file it, click the E-File Report button at the bottom of the screen. You’ll then have a field to enter in a password. Each filing agency has its password process so in some cases, depending on the agency, you’ll see multiple fields. These passwords and tokens are provided to you by your filing agency.

In ISP is a safeguard for your passwords. Click the Save to Password Safe checkbox and save your password for future filings. If the password changes, you can edit the password the next time you e-file a report.

It’s important to note not all filing agencies support e-filing. If you have any questions or concerns with this, please contact Support.

# ABOUT THE MN 24 HOUR CAND REPORT

About the MN 24 Hour CAND Report
==========

Applies To: Minnesota

The MN 24-Hour CAND Report is for candidate committees to report contributions and loans from any one source totaling more than $1,000 during the 24-Hour Report Period. These must be reported to the Board in person by the end of the next business day after receipt or by electronic filing within 24 hours after the receipt. These transactions will also be included in subsequent reports of receipts and expenditures for the year.

For election years, there is a gap between the last date of the Pre-Primary election report and the primary date, and between the last date of the Pre-General election period and the General election. Any contributions of $1,000 or more will need to be reported if happening during that time. Currently, the MN 24-Hour CAND does not support loans received.

After generating the MN 24-Hour CAND report, download the PDF and submit the itemized transactions to the state’s 24-Hour Notice Online Application by logging into your [state account](https://notice.cfb.mn.gov/reporting/login).

# WHAT IS A BOOKKEEPING TRANSACTION AND HOW DO I ADD ONE

What Is a Bookkeeping Transaction and How Do I Add One?
==========

Sometimes a quick correction to Cash On Hand balances on reports is needed. You can do this by utilizing the Bookkeeping option on the Other Entities page.

In order to find out the specific bookkeeping transaction type needed, first determine if the COH total is higher or lower than expected.

* If the COH is lower, create a contribution with a date far in the past, such as 1/1/1900, in the amount that’s the difference.
* If the COH total is higher, create an expense in that amount, again with a date far in the past.

Please be aware these are quick fixes and should only be used after all discrepancy research has been completed and no solution is found.

# WHAT IS AI ISP

What Is ai@ISP?
==========

ai@ISP is an intelligent bot that will help you manage your work and is there to take care of mundane tasks for you so you can focus on what’s important.

Navigate to ai@ISP under the Tools tab and in the Settings section, use the slider to toggle on or off the AI function. With it turned on, new options appear.

**Auto-Combine Duplicates:** ai@ISP will combine duplicate entities that exist in your database using the Exact search criteria. ai@ISP will only combine when there is a matching name and matching contact information.

**Auto-Imports:** ai@ISP will process pending imports. These are pending transactions found in the Imports section on the Dashboard. Auto-Import settings give you the ability to predetermine how transactions from an integration come into ISP. You can set the following fields for your transactions:

* Budget Category
* Election
* Financial Account
* Reporting Code (Expenses)
* Mark transactions as thanked

**Auto-Mark As Filed:** ai@ISP will mark a compliance report as filed if you forget to do it upon a successful filing.

**Send Missing Occupation/Employer Emails:** ai@ISP will email reportable donors if they are missing their occupation or employer, asking them to reply with that information. When the donor responds, ai@ISP will automatically update their record based on their response. Everyone on the recipient’s list will be forwarded a copy of any emails received and notified about what ai has done.

**Send Alerts:** ai@ISP will send you alerts and regular reports.

Depending on your other options, this can include:

* Reminders to file late contribution reports and similar transaction based reports
* Periodic recommendations for new scheduled reports
* Over the limit alerts
* Donor responses to occupation/employer requests and how ai@ISP handled them.
* Financial concerns, including languishing undeposited transactions and overdrawn accounts

**Alert Recipients** These are the people that ai@ISP will keep updated about important information and what ai is doing.

If you manage multiple accounts, you can enable AI to perform the same functions with those accounts, as well. This will be a blanket setting for all accounts. If you’d prefer to specify which accounts have which AI features toggled on or off, you click the Customize button to set AI for your accounts individually.

**Manage Flags:** Sometimes, when adding or updating entities, they fall into a group of entities that already have an established flag due to a specific query. You can now request that ai@ISP take care of updating flags. This option can be found when creating a query through Advanced Search.

**Manage Reminders:** Similar to managing Flags, ai@ISP will add a reminder to a record.

In the Data Updates section, AI can handle even more detailed tasks, mostly for Occupation/Employer requirements, but others as well. For example, AI can set the Business Type in an Organization entity’s record if one is not set already.

# HOW DO I LOCATE FOREIGN ADDRESSES USING ADVANCED SEARCH

How Do I Locate Foreign Addresses Using Advanced Search?
==========

If you’re looking for foreign addresses in your database, below is an Advanced Search recipe you can use to locate them.

* **Area:** Addresses
* **Field:** State
* **Relationship:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** Blank

Note: Select the blank option from the Value drop-down menu rather than leaving it blank. The blank option appears at the top of the drop-down menu and, once selected, will appear in the Value box as a lowercase x within a square.

After you click the Add Rule button to add it to the Search Criteria section, you can generate the list of foreign addresses using either the Run Search button or the Exports & Actions button. The latter button will allow you to export the data to a spreadsheet to view and sort more detailed information.

If you plan to generate this list regularly, click the Save & Run Search button to save the search criteria for future use. This will prevent the need to add the same criteria every time you want to generate this list. After you have named the search, you’ll see the search name in the drop-up menu of the Saved Searches button.

# POLICY ON LEGAL ADVICE

Policy on Legal Advice
==========

When it comes to Compliance reporting, each filing agency comes with their own set of rules and guidelines. These can sometimes be complex. However, filing accurate compliance reports is very important. Because of this, we tend to shy away from providing legal advice when it comes to reports. In these instances, we highly recommend contacting your legal analyst or committee’s legal department for any legal matters you may encounter when preparing and/or generating your compliance report before filing.

# HOW DO I ADD A BALLOT MEASURE

How Do I Add a Ballot Measure?
==========

There are two ways of adding Ballot Measures to the database, either on the Other Entities page under the Lists tab or when creating a transaction.

How do I add a Ballot Measure on the Other Entities page?
----------

1. Navigate to Other Entities under the Lists tab. This page will show any existing entities or items that are undefinable, such as Anonymous or Bookkeeping transactions.
2. Click the Add Other Entity button at the bottom of the screen
3. In the window that appears, for Type, be sure to click Ballot Measure. Besides just the Name field, you’ll then see new fields appear: Ballot Measure Name, Letter or Number, Jurisdiction, and Jurisdiction Description. Of these, the Ballot Measure Name and Jurisdiction fields are required.
4. When the info has been added, click Add Other Entity to add the Ballot Measure to the Other Entities list

How do I add a Ballot Measure through a transaction?
----------

When adding an expense to support or oppose a ballot measure, you can add the ballot measure “on the fly.”

1. Navigate to Accounting, then to Add Transaction
2. Select Expense from the dropdown
3. In the transaction details, scroll down and click the Specify Support/Oppose option
4. In the Entity field, type in the ballot name
5. Click the Add Ballot Measure option
6. In the modal that appears, complete the fields and click Add Ballot Measure

How do I link a ballot measure and ballot measure committee?
----------

If you need to associate your ballot measure with a ballot measure
committee, navigate to the committee record and complete the following
steps.

1. In the Relationships section, click the add symbol in the top right corner
2. In the Affiliated field, type in the name of the ballot measure you just created
3. In the Relationship Type drop down menu, choose either Ballot Measure Support or Ballot Measure Oppose
4. Click Add Relationship

Note on Names

----------

----------

When naming the Ballot Measure, it is good practice to
be able to know the difference between the Ballot Measure name and the
name of the Ballot Measure Committee. This will lessen the confusion
when attempting to link Ballot Measures to Ballot Measure Committees and
avoid system errors.

**Ballot Measure:** This is the name on the ballot.

**Ballot Measure Committee:** This is what the organization supporting the ballot measure is called.

# WHAT ARE TRANSACTION LIMITS

What Are Transaction Limits?
==========

ISP has built-in warnings to inform you when transactions that are manually added to the system are over the transaction limit.

If you manually add a transaction that exceeds the contribution limit, the system will display a text warning at the top of the page and alert you with a sound. You will still be able to add the transaction, but an alert will let you know the threshold has been crossed.

There are a few other important things to know when it comes to transaction limits in ISP:

* If there are transactions in the Pending Imports page that will go over the limit, you will receive a warning there that the threshold has been crossed.
* ISP has an AI option that will conduct imports for you. You can [set AI to watch for transactions over the limit](https://ispolitical.com/setting-the-ai-alert-for-over-the-limit-contributions/) and send an email listing them. Furthermore, AI will not automatically import transactions over the limit in the Pending Imports page but will instead alert you.
* We have a Check Transaction Limits report that allows you to generate a report of transactions that may be over the allowable transaction limit. You can narrow your search by Filer (if you have multiple filers in your database) and by Date Range. You can access this report by navigating to the Compliance Tools tab under Reports on the account dashboard.
* To ensure your limits are set correctly, go to Reports, then to Compliance. At the bottom of the page, click Related Pages and select Manage Filers. Click on [See Details] to populate the filer limits below. If the limits are incorrect, access your filer record to ensure the jurisdiction in your Committee and/or Candidate record is set correctly.
* For Super PACs: In general, these committee types are not subject to [transaction limits](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/taking-receipts-pac/contributions-to-super-pacs-and-hybrid-pacs/). If you receive a warning about a transaction over the limit, check the Committee Type setting in the Committee record in your database. If it is anything other than Super PAC, update this to eliminate the transaction limit warning.
* For PAC – Joint Fundraising Committees: These committee types are generally not subject to [transaction limits](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/taking-receipts-pac/contributions-to-super-pacs-and-hybrid-pacs/). If you receive a warning about a transaction over the limit, ensure your filing committee is set as a Political Committee in the organization record. Next, go to the Reports menu and select Compliance. Then, click on the Related Pages button at the bottom of the screen. From this button’s drop-up menu, select Manage Filers. On the Filers page, choose Convert to PAC – Joint Fundraising Committee in the hotdog menu.

# WHAT ARE THE TABS ON THE DASHBOARD

What Are the Tabs on the Dashboard?
==========

When you log into your database and arrive on the Dashboard, at the top of the page is a row of tabs. Below each tab are pages you can navigate to. Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of the tab name to view the available pages.

If you do not see any tabs at all, most likely the browser view or scaling has increased, which causes the tab names to disappear and move into a dropdown list in the top right of the screen. If this happens, you’ll see three stacked horizontal lines where the tabs will be listed. To get the tab names back on screen, decrease the browser view until they reappear.

The pages below each tab are grouped by similar actions or purpose. For example, the Accounting tab contains pages that are relevant to accounting practices available in ISP, while the Reports tab will be where you can generate and export reports, including Compliance reports.

If you manage multiple databases as part of a Firm, you’ll see a Consultant Tools menu in the bottom right corner of the screen. Here are pages that allow for various data flow between databases options or bulk database actions. You can also view the Firm details.

# HOW DOES THE FEC REPORT NEW DEBTS UNDER 5

How Does the FEC Report New Debts Under $500?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

1. FEC debt itemization rules:

* Debt itemizes on Schedule D if outstanding for 60 days or
more or if they have an original amount, beginning balance, or
outstanding balance of $500.01 or more.
* Debt should be reported as newly incurred debt when itemized, even if it originated in the prior reporting period.

These Accrued Expenses did not meet the itemization
requirement for the mid-year report, so they do not appear on that
report as itemized. They are included in the Line 10 Debts and
Obligations Owed total on the mid-year report.

**2. When debt is paid off (by the committee, forgiven, or
third-party payment), it needs to itemize on Sch D, even if it usually
would not at that time.**

The FEC wants Balance Reductions (forgiven debt or third-party
payments) to show as a negative in the Amount Incurred This Period
field, but this field also needs to show that the debt was incurred during this
period per the rules above.

We resolve this conflict on reports by reporting the debt as
incurred and automatically including text after Sch D explaining that it
was paid off via forgiven or third-party payment. The text that pulls
after Sch D says something like: “Outstanding Debt Amount of {Original
AE Amount} was reduced in the amount of {AE Balance Reduction Amount} by
forgiveness or third party repayment.”

# ABOUT THE MN 24 HOUR PCF REPORT

About the MN 24 Hour PCF Report
==========

Applies To: Minnesota

The MN 24-Hour PCF Report is for contributions and loans from any one source totaling more than $1,000 during the 24-Hour Reporting Period must be reported to the Board in person by the end of the next business day after receipt or by electronic means within 24 hours after receipt and also on subsequent Reports of Receipts and Expenditures for the year.

During election years, there is a gap between the last date of the pre-primary-election report and the date of the primary, as well as another gap between the last date of the pre-general election and the general election. During those two time periods, this report needs to be filed if your committee receives a contribution of $1,000 or more. The MN 24-Hour PCF report does not support Loans Received.

To file, log onto your [state agency’s filing](https://notice.cfb.mn.gov/reporting/login) system for the 24 Hour report.

# ABOUT THE PA DSEB 5 2 REPORT

About the PA DSEB-502 Report
==========

Applies To: Pennsylvania

The PA DSEB-502 Form is used for candidates, political committees, and contributing lobbyists who must disclose contributions and expenditures. The aggregate total of contributions will determine which part of the report form should be used to disclose a contribution or receipt.

* A record must be kept of the receipt, dates of contribution, name, and addresses of each person from whom a contribution of over $10 has been received. Contributions and receipts of $50 or less should appear on Schedule I, Contributions and Receipts Detailed Summary Page, Line 1.
* Contributions and receipts between $50 to $250 will need to be reported on Schedule I, Part A, Contributions Received from Political Committees, or Part B, All Other Contributions.
* Contributions and receipts over $250 should be displayed on Schedule I, Part C, Contributions Received from Political Committees, or Part D. All Other Contributions.

If you are filing an annual report that covers the full year instead of the standard end-of-year period, you will be prompted to change the cycle start dates when uploading the third-party files. Per the advice of the state, click YES to change the cycle start dates. In doing that, the View Preview function will no longer work – you will have to submit the report without previewing.

To file your report, you must generate and download your e-file to upload to your filing account. You can log in and file your report with your [state account](https://www.campaignfinanceonline.pa.gov/Pages/Login.aspx).

# WHAT IS THE FILE COMPLIANCE REPORTS PAGE IN CONSULTANT TOOLS

What Is the File Compliance Reports Page in Consultant Tools?
==========

If you manage multiple accounts, it can be tricky to keep up with all the Compliance reports you have to file. Using the File Compliance Reports page for Consultants, you can efile them all at the same time.

From within the specific database, generate the report and when you have confirmed all the details are correct, click the Save for Filing button. After you have generated the various reports you need to file, navigate to this page under the Consultant Tools dropup menu. On the resulting page you’ll see several columns.

**Account Name:** This column displays the Account in which you generated your report.

**Agency:** The Agency column tells you which filing agency the report will be filed to.

**Report Name:** This line of info provides several pieces of information. It will show you the account’s schema name, the abbreviation for the filer name, which report it is, and the date range.

**Generated:** This shows the date and timestamp for when the report was generated.

In the hot dog menu to the right of each report are options for downloading the report. You can download the PDF or the efile. It also contains an option to mark the report as filed, if that step was missed at some point along the way.

To e-file the report, click the E-file button.

# WHAT ARE THE ACTBLUE SETTINGS

What Are the ActBlue Settings?
==========

With your ActBlue integration, you have several areas of customization within ISP. This includes adding specific Budget Categories to incoming donations. If you use different ActBlue forms for data capture, you can also predetermine which Budget Categories are applied for each form.

The Customize Budget Category section allows you to determine which Budget Category is applied to the donation no matter the form that is used. You can use a Budget Category already in your database, or you can select the Create Children option to create new budget categories that match the values we get from ActBlue. This allows for the use of the ActBlue as the main budget category, while still getting some nuance of different ActBlue Pages.

If you have multiple forms, you can use the Per Form Categories section to set the Budget Category for each form, if they are different.

Please note that these processes will override any Auto-Import [AI settings](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-ai-isp/) for the Quick Import section.

# HOW DO I REPORT FEC LATE PARTNERSHIP INFORMATION

How Do I Report FEC Late Partnership Information?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

There may be times where you receive Partnership splits after the whole/parent contribution has been reported. In this case, per FEC guidance, your only course of action is to file an amendment. If you file a Form 99 or try to include the partnership information on a later report either as a memo or a reattribution/redesignation, you will receive a RFAI letter. The only way the FEC will accept this additional partnership information is via amendments.

If you are waiting on other partnership letters, you can wait until you receive all the expected letters, then file the amendment.

The final recommendation is to include a note with the filed report. You can use this as a basic template, if needed:

“We have made best efforts to obtain the partnership letters before the filing due date for the contribution from {name of partnership} on {date} for {amount}. The report will be amended at a later date when that information is obtained.”

# WHAT ARE THE SORT ORDER OPTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE REPORTS

What Are the Sort Order Options for Compliance Reports?
==========

Sort Order is a cosmetic option for how transactions are organized on most reports. It can be helpful to review your data in a specific order on a PDF report, but it is not a requirement for most agencies.

If you have conduits or multiple splits on transactions, you may find the (split with whole) options below more helpful with reviewing. Some wholes and splits must appear in particular sections of a report and these Sort Order options will not change any requirement necessary for filing.

Sort Order Options
----------

**Alphabetical**: This will sort transactions based on Entity name.

**Date**: This will sorts transactions based on the date of the transaction.

**Alphabetical (splits with wholes)**: With Alphabetical (Split with Whole), the whole follows the standard alphabetical sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same name, the splits further itemize by date order. If there is more than one split with the same name AND date, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Date (splits with wholes)**: With Date (Split with Whole), the whole follows the standard date sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in date order. If there is more than one split with the same date, the splits further itemize by alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same date AND name, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Random**: This sorts transactions in a random pattern.

# WHAT IS AUTHY AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Authy and How Do I Use It?
==========

Data safety is an important part of ISP. Because of this, we employ Two-Factor Authentication processes to keep your data safe. Two of those methods, One-Touch and TOTP, require an app called Authy.

First, navigate to Two-Factor Authentication under the Systems tab. Click the green triangle in the right corner of My settings and choose either One-Touch or TOTP.

**One-Touch:** Tap the Approve option within the Authy app to access the database.

**TOTP:** This process generates one-time passwords in order to access the database.

When you make your choice and complete the rest of the fields, you’ll get a text with: “On your phone’s browser, go to http://authy.com/install to install your two-factor authentication tool.”

Install the app on your phone. You’ll be prompted to enter your phone number and get verification by call or SMS. If you choose SMS and do not receive the text message, try again with a phone call. Once installed, you’ll see ISPolitical already available to use for one-touch or TOTP.

If you choose One-Touch, in the app tap the bell in the top right corner. On the resulting screen you’ll see Approve or Deny option. Tap the Approve button and ISP will automatically open for you.

If you select TOTP, an ISPolitical token (aka password) will appear and provide an expiration countdown. Enter this token in the prompt on ISP and you’ll then be granted access to the database.

# ISPOLITICAL AI CHANGING ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE

ISPolitical: AI changing Accounting Software
==========

<img alt="Group 326" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-326.png" title="Group 326" height="648" width="1366" />

In today’s world, upgrading and modernizing are par for the course and not keeping pace means becoming obsolete real quick.. Manufacturing is getting more efficient, computers are faster and smaller than ever, and information is shared at a breakneck pace. But the world of political accounting software hasn’t kept pace.

At least, it didn’t. Until we came along.

AI Political Accounting Software…Wait, is That a Thing?
----------

We just took a giant leap forward in making your life easier by being the first political accounting software company to introduce artificial intelligence. This is going to save you valuable and critical time, money, and effort. With our AI based accounting software, instead of leaving the office at midnight, red-eyed and caffeine addled, maybe you’ll start leaving a few hours sooner, and finish that last slice of pizza you ordered for the interns in the privacy of your own home (radical concept, we know).

What’s AI All About Anyway?
----------

So what is this revolutionary technology? Before you go looking up AI on Wikipedia for a refresher course (or a plot synopsis of Terminator), let me try an analogy. We all have that one intern—they’re slightly slow, pretty inexperienced, but work harder than even some of your paid staff, right? They don’t know everything, but they get better as they go. That’s exactly what we created: the moderately intelligent intern, in computer form. Best of all, this one doesn’t need rides home, won’t quote the same three episodes of The West Wing endlessly, and you’ll never need to write it a letter of recommendation.

How AI Can Help With Political Accounting
----------

So, how is artificial intelligence changing political accounting? AI@ISP does menial tasks, looking over repetitive data and performing some trivial actions, but far faster than you or your intern ever could. It saves you from the long, obnoxious parts of your job. Best of all, it gets better over time; AI really is intelligent and will learn how to do its job even more efficiently as it runs. But don’t be alarmed, this isn’t the start of the robot takeover. You definitely won’t have your job stolen by this AI based accounting software. Or, at least, not the fun parts. Unless you’re an intern. Then you should be scared.

What, Specifically, Can AI do to Help With Political Accounting?
----------

Let’s get into the specifics of what AI@ISP does with some examples of where it thrives. AI combs through your filings so you don’t have to, looking for ways to improve, for things that won’t pass compliance, and even for target audiences who might be willing to do a little campaign donating. It excels at pouring over lists of data, looking for anomalies that would normally be your job. Why spend time scrutinizing a donor list or hunting for duplicates when AI can do it in seconds? All that time wasted trying to combine duplicate records can be saved. Better still, *automated*!

Safety, It’s On Everyone’s Mind

We also made it safe. If it comes across a duplicate situation that it isn’t sure about, it’ll defer to you. AI@ISP also imports online donations in your database, auto-combining with existing records and recording everything for you. If you have repeat donors, it’ll log those too, providing important metrics for your campaign. Further, it has automatic red flags that are meant to focus your attention on critical donations. There are triggers built in that notify you of possibly risky donations—monetary limits, type of donation, where it comes from, etc. It stays sharp even when you don’t. Our AI political accounting software is designed to help you make sure every donation taken is safe, streamlining your job and increasing the efficiency of the campaign you serve.

AI: All That and a Bag of Chips
----------

This incredible tool isn’t a panacea, but we don’t think it should be! This is a 95% tool, something that does almost everything, but leaves the important calls to you. The last thing we want to do is make a mistake that will cause you trouble, so our robot will make sure big decisions are in the hands of people with authority. It recognizes that there are just some situations where it isn’t qualified to make a decision, just like a good intern should!

We set out to build software that lives up to our company’s values: it needs to be responsive, smart, and useful. It needs to learn at all times, making sure it’s changing where necessary to be as helpful as possible. With our new AI, we met that mark on all counts. Its insistence on learning from the client is fundamental to its nature, just like ours.

Do you have ideas about how AI@ISP could be even more helpful or questions regarding this or any of our other services, please don’t hesitate to [contact](https://ispolitical.com/contact/) us!

# WHAT ARE THE DASHBOARD CHARTS AND GRAPHS

What Are the Dashboard Charts and Graphs?
==========

On the right-hand side of the Dashboard are three different charts and graphs. These provide a visual display of the data in your database.

### Receipts By Budget Category ###

This pie chart contains all of the receipts entered into your database and organizes them by Budget Category. They are separated by dollar amount so that you can see where you are spending the most and least amounts of money in your campaign. There is also a checkbox that you can tick on or off that will either include or exclude Inkind contributions with this data in the pie chart. Clicking each pie slice will direct you to the Transactions report for that specific Budget Category piece.

### Disbursements By Budget Category ###

This pie chart contains all of the disbursements entered and organizes them by Budget Category. Additionally, this chart will organize the data by the amount of each disbursement so that you can keep track of how much of your budget is going to each area. Clicking each pie slice will direct you to the Transactions report for that specific Budget Category piece.

### Cash on Hand Over Time ###

This line graph will show a timeline of your cash on hand. The X-axis of the chart will show the amount of cash on hand and the Y-axis of the chart will show the monthly timeline for your cash on hand.

# WHAT ARE REMINDERS

What Are Reminders?
==========

Reminders in ISP are used to make sure you and your staff are keeping up with communications, both incoming and outgoing. You can set reminders for yourself or another user on the account and there are many ways you can utilize Reminders in your database. Various uses they can be used for are to remind yourself or others to call someone back, to remind someone about a pledge they made, and more.

First, if you don’t have the standard Reminders tool installed, install the Tool from the Tools menu. Select the Add/Remove option, then on the resulting screen, scroll through the available options or type Reminders into the Search field. Click on the Reminders tile to install.

Once the tool is installed, you’ll see the Reminder section in entity records.

To set a Reminder, navigate to the entity’s record and in the Reminders section on the right and click the Add icon (+) in the right corner. In the window that appears, complete the required fields denoted with an asterisk, then click Add Reminder. This will place the reminder in the Reminder section in the record and also on the Dashboard of the User you assigned it to, if not yourself.

Please be aware that reminders will not show on the dashboard until 24 hours before it’s due.

# HOW DO I TRACK PLEDGES

How Do I Track Pledges?
==========

Sometimes a donor makes a promise to contribute to the campaign in the future. In that situation, you can use the Pledge option to track that promised donation. These can be tracked in two different places, either on the Dashboard or within the entity’s record itself.

### From the Dashboard ###

On the Dashboard is a Pledge Aging section. Here you’ll see totals of any remaining outstanding donation pledges grouped by date ranges. To the right of each date range is the hot dog menu. Using this you can choose to export the outstanding pledge data to a spreadsheet, call sheets, or view the records that have outstanding pledges.

If you see a date and time showing in the Pledge Aging section, this indicates the last time the report was updated. Click the Update option to bring the data current. If you don’t see a date and time, the report is current.

### From within the record ###

In any given record is a section called Pledges & Targets. In there you’ll see the following columns: Fulfilled Amount and Outstanding.

* **Fulfilled Amount:** This lets you know how much towards the full pledge amount has already been donated.
* **Outstanding:** If there is a remaining balance of the pledge, this amount will show in the Outstanding column.

In order to add donations towards the campaign pledge amount, click the date of the pledge and when the window appears, enter in a Fulfilled Amount or click the Is Written Off option if the pledge has been forgiven or written off.

# HOW DO I THANK DONORS VIEW PREVIOUSLY THANKED DONORS

How Do I Thank Donors & View Previously Thanked Donors?
==========

Thanking donors for their contributions is one way of showing your appreciation for the donation. In ISP, you can generate a list of donors to thank and mark them as Thanked so you don’t send them multiple letters or emails.

When you arrive on the Thank Donors page, the section header displays how many donors you have to thank based on the contributions received and added to the database. If you’d like to be more specific about who you thank and mark as Thanked, you can select various criteria to target specific donors.

There are two ways to view donors and their thanked status: (1) Not Thanked, and (2) Previously Generated.

### Not Thanked ###

If you choose to thank donors based on Budget Category, this dropdown will tell you how many donors and donations have that specific Budget Category associated with the transaction.

In the Format dropdown, available export formats for thanking donors appear. If you’d like to edit this list, click the [Custom Exports](https://ispolitical.com/custom-exports/) button at the bottom of the screen.

# WHAT ARE PLEDGES TARGETS AND HOW DO I ADD THEM TO RECORDS

What Are Pledges & Targets and How Do I Add Them to Records?
==========

Using Pledges & Targets is a way of setting financial goals, whether directed by a donor or staff, and are a useful tool for fundraising and tracking donations. These are created from within records, both Individuals and Organizations.

First navigate the record you’d like to add the Pledge or Target to, then scroll down until you see the section. In the right corner of the section, click the Add option (+) and the window to add either a Pledge or Target will appear.

**Pledge:** If you speak with someone and they are unable to make a donation but would be willing to in the future, they are making a pledge for a donation.

**Target:** Sometimes you want to set donation goals for a certain entity. This allows you to create that target to reach for when fundraising.

In the window, use the slider to select Pledge or Target, depending on which transaction you’re creating. The Date and Amount are required but other fields are optional. The Owner menu allows you to choose who on staff will be responsible for making sure the target amount is met or contacting the entity to fulfill the pledge.

These [Pledges can be tracked](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-and-track-pledges/) in ISP, allowing you opportunity to not only see if your committee is on track financially but also review donor pledges in order to get them fulfilled.

**Billing Rates:** The Billing Rates section shows what the accounts billing rates and dates are.

1. In the Type dropdown, select Non-Monetary Expense
2. In the Entity field, enter in the vendor used in the Split of the previous transaction
3. Click Specify Support/Oppose
4. In the Entity field that appears, enter in the support candidate or ballot measure

# HOW DO I CREATE NEW RELATIONSHIPS

How Do I Create New Relationships?
==========

Relationships in records are an important way of linking entities. Not only do they play a significant factor in Compliance reporting, they are also good ways of showing how entities are connected.

There are many Relationship types to choose from. These range from committee staff to family members and friends to employee and employer, and many more in between.

One option when creating the relationship is marking it as the Primary relationship. This would be considered the most important person within an organization and can also have an impact on compliance reports.

In order to set a Relationship between entities, navigate to the entity’s record. Locate the Relationships section and in the top right corner, click the green triangle with a plus sign (+) in the right corner.

In the window that appears, type in the name of the entity in the Affiliated field of the entity you want to link with a Relationship. If they are not already in your database, you’ll have the option of creating a new entity right there on the spot.

After you’ve selected or created the Affiliated entity, select the type of Relationship from the dropdown menu.

Once you’ve determined the Affiliated entity and its Relationship, as well as the optional choices of Primary relationship links, click the Add Relationship button, or the Add & New to create the relationship and immediately add a new Relationship.

# WHY IS MY IE APPEARING ON LINE 21 B ABOUT PAYING FIRST AND DISSEMINATING LATER

Why Is My IE Appearing on Line 21(B)? About Paying First and Disseminating Later
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

The following information impacts Form 3x & Form 3x (Party).

When an expense is paid in one period, but the IE is dated for a future period/dissemination date, the [FEC](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-pac-reports/paying-ie-first-and-disseminating-later-reporting-period/) has a specific way they want to see this itemized.

The IE is reported three times:

1. The original/parent expense is reported on Line 21b in accordance with the report period of the original/parent transaction date. There is no Support/Oppose Memo information on the transaction.
2. When the Support/Oppose Memo date falls in the appropriate report period, we “move” the transaction from Line 21b to Line 24 / Sch E. This is done by reporting the original/parent expense as a negative on Line 21b.
3. On the same report, the IE is also reported on Line 24 / Sch E with all of the appropriate Candidate/Committee information.

This will impact your per-line totals, especially in Col B. But because we are itemizing the transaction as a negative on Line 21b, the overall impact on your ending cash on hand is negated.

# WHAT S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN E FILE AND PAPER ONLY REPORTS FOR NEVADA

What’s the Difference Between E-file and Paper Only Reports for Nevada?
==========

Applies To: Nevada

###  ###

The state of Nevada determines what transactions are itemized. Because of this, we have two versions: Paper Only, to review and see how the report will look on the state’s site, and E-File, to ensure all transactions are properly transmitted to the state for accurate aggregation. Nevada state law requires all C&E Reports and Financial Disclosure Statements to be filed electronically using the AURORA Campaign Finance Disclosure system.

**Version: Paper Only**

* When you generate a Paper Only version, the itemization is pre-set to $100.01.
* Paper Only Versions are used for the sole purpose of review in order to get an approximation of the state’s itemization.

**Version: E-Filing**

* Due to Nevada’s limitations of E-File procedures, our system uploads all transactions. The state will perform the calculations on their end to determine what is to be itemized.
* If you create a PDF and generated the report using the E-File version, all transactions will be itemized on that same PDF. This will not give you an accurate representation of how the report displays on the state’s site after uploading.

**Notes About Uploading E-Files and using AURORA**

* AURORA does not have the ability to link any loan forgiveness transaction to its original loan. This will require you to manually enter those into the state’s system.
* When you generate the report using the E-File version, that same E-File will be downloaded via a .zip folder. Inside that .zip folder you will see two files: Contributions.csv and Expenditures.csv.
* You can then use those two CSV files to bulk upload transactions, which will then be moved over to the AURORA electronic filing system.

# ABOUT THE WA C3 REPORT

About the WA C3 Report
==========

Applies To: Washington

The WA C3 is a transaction deposit based report for any monetary receipts that have been deposited into an account. These [deposits are created in ISP](https://ispolitical.com/How-Do-I-Record-a-Deposit/) under the Accounting tab. After a deposit is made, you will then see it in the Deposit Transaction dropdown on the WA C3 criteria screen.

While it is a report of a Deposit Batch, Washington does not support including any non-cash positive transactions on it. This will have an effect on, for example, a deposit batch with contributions, reversed contributions, and expenses (e.g. credit card fees). The C3 will only include the contributions and thus will be a different total amount than the deposit batch actually was.

Typically, the receipt date for donations is the date the contribution is deposited into the bank account. However, in Seattle races, the date reported is the date you are notified of the contribution.

In order to account for this, there are several report versions to choose from.

* **Candidate:** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the date of the deposit.
* **Itemize All:** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the date of the deposit.
* **Out of State:** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the date of the deposit.
* **Seattle:** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the transaction date.
* **Seattle (Itemize All):** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the transaction date.
* **Seattle (Out of State):** If the Method is Credit Card, the Date of the transaction will be the transaction date.

**Section 1: Monetary Contributions Deposited In Account**

This section will contain all the various cash impact transactions that were deposited. These are:

a. Anonymous
b. Candidate’s personal funds
c. Loans, notes, security agreements
d. Miscellaneous receipts (i.e. interest, refunds)
e. Receipts under $25

For line (e), the C3 report will also tell you how many people make up that total amount.

**Section 2: Contributions Over $25.00**

Any individual contributions over $25 found in the deposit for this report will itemize here. If the amount is over $250, the donor’s Employer information will appear. That means someone needs to donate $250.01 or more for their Employer information to populate.

If the donor’s contribution is over $100 and no Work address is in the donor’s record, a warning will appear and the address must be added for the report to be compliant.

**Section 3: Total Funds Received and Deposited or Credited to Account**

This section contains the sum of Sections 1 and 2. This amount will also be used for Line 1 on the C4 report.

**Section 4: Date of Deposit**

This section automatically populates based on the Date used for the deposit in the report.

Please be aware that refunds will not show up on the WA-C3. This goes for expenses, as well. If there is a refund or an expense that is in a deposit batch, it will be included on the WA-C4 but not the WA-C3. This is due to agency limits.

==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

To qualify as a multicandidate committee, a political committee must:

* Be registered for at least 6 months;
* Receive contributions from more than 50 persons; and
* Make contributions to at least 5 Federal candidates. (This requirement does not apply to State party committees.)

This form must be filed within 10 days after meeting the qualification criteria.

You can generate the Form 1M (Notice of Multi-Candidate Status) for either Status by Qualification or Status by Affiliation.

For Status of Affiliation ensure the following:

1. The affiliated committee is linked to the filer entity record via Relationships, and the relationship is marked as Primary for the filer
2. Check the Achieved Status by Affiliation box on the criteria screen when generating the report

For Status of Qualification ensure the following:

1. The report date range used includes 5 expenses made to candidates

… State
… Office Sought (or Held)
… Office Sought (or Held) Jurisdiction must be set to Federal
… Office Sought (or Held) District Number

# HOW DO I ADD CANDIDATE AND COMMITTEE RECORDS DIRECTLY FROM THE WA PDC

How Do I Add Candidate and Committee Records Directly From the WA PDC?
==========

Applies To: Washington

In ISP you can add Committee and Candidate records to your database directly from the WA PDC site when using the Search option at the top of the screen. The imported information will include critical data, such as address, ID number, and other financial information.

First, if you haven’t yet, enable the WA PDC Search feature by navigating to the System tab and then to Account Management. On the resulting screen, locate the Account Preferences section and toggle on the option to include the data in searches.

After this feature has been enabled, when searching for committee records not already in your database, you’ll see the name you were searching for and a message allowing you to import from WA PDC data.

Clicking this will automatically add the record to your database and any pertinent information required for filing and standard information purposes.

On the Organization search page under the Add/Search tab, you’ll also see an option to Exclude matches from WA PDC data. This will help you limit the results on your screen.

# HOW DO I ADD THE STRIPE INTEGRATION IN ISP

How Do I Add the Stripe Integration in ISP?
==========

***We no longer support the Stripe integration. Please see the list of other [integration and credit card processing options](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-the-Credit-Card-Processing-Options-at-ISP) that work very well with ISP.***

Many of our integration partners offer robust and highly effective systems to integrate with your ISP database. While we highly suggest using those, we also support using your own Stripe account, a more limited infrastructure platform, for integration purposes.

The Stripe Integration page in ISP allows you to create Stripe donation pages within ISP that are linked to your Stripe account.

Please be aware that a Stripe account is required for the use of this feature.

In ISP, the Stripe Integration option under the Integrations tab will first place you on the Donation Pages screen where you’ll see all of the donation pages you’ve created.

If you have not created any pages yet, you can click the Add Donation Page button below. However, there are still steps you’ll be required to take first before you can a donation page.

At the bottom of the page you’ll see other navigation buttons, Manage Stripe Connections and Manage Donation Emails.

First start by clicking the Manage Stripe Connections button. On the resulting page, click the Add Stripe Detail button located at the bottom of the page. A window will appear only with the Filers in your own account, as well as fields for Public and Private keys, including test keys. These keys are found in your Stripe account.

Take the following steps in your Stripe account to gather the key information you need.

1. Go to the Menu, then click on Developers, then on API Keys
2. This will show your publishable key. Click Reveal live key token to get it
3. For test keys, click on View test data at the top right
4. Repeat Step 2 above to retrieve the test keys

You’ll also see Mode options for Live and Test. If you would like to first use the page as a testing ground to ensure it works, select Test mode. Once you have worked out any kinks, you can change the mode to Live and make it available to the public. Test credit card numbers can be found here.

Once you’ve added all the necessary details, click Add Stripe Detail.

At this point, return to the Donations Page and create your donation page.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Stripe via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Stripe will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

# ABOUT OTHER ENTITIES

About Other Entities
==========

Other Entities are used for non-corporeal concepts. They’re not widely used but most accounts will have one or two. They generally should be avoided unless absolutely needed.

The most common are:

* **Anonymous**: For when you don’t know where this money came from.
* **Bookkeeping**: For when there has been a manual adjustment to fix a past error.

Some agencies have very specific other entities. Check your agency specific help file documents for more information.

# WHAT ARE ESTIMATED EXPENSES FOR FORM 5 AND 24 48 HOUR IE REPORTS

What Are Estimated Expenses for Form 5 and 24/48 Hour IE Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

The FEC Form 5 and 24/48 hour Independent Expenditures (IE) reports are unique from many other agencies in that committees are expected to provide an estimated cost of the IE on the 24/48 hour IE report, then disclose the actual amount on the Quarterly Form 5 (if known at that time).

For tihs purpose we have a special transaction type called Estimated Expense. With this transaction type you can first record the estimate, then update it with the actual amount later. The Estimated Expense is not cash impacting and ISP handles any required compliance notes indicating it’s an estimate.

Take the following steps to create this transaction.

1. Navigate to Accounting \> Add Transaction.
2. Select the Type Estimated Expense.
3. Fill out the details of the expenditure.
4. Complete the Support/Oppose section. Since this is an IE, the target of the expenditure should be indicated as supported or opposed.

At this point you will have a non-cash impacting transaction for the Estimated Expense. When you run your 24/48 hour IE report, this transaction will be used to pull information to the report to file.

Once you know the actual amount of the expenditure, use the following steps to update the Estimated Expense transaction:

1. Navigate to the record with the Estimated Expense that needs to be updated.
2. Click on the hotdog menu to the right of the Estimated Expense transaction.
In the list of options, click on Add Actual Expense.
3. Fill out the details for the actual expenditure amount.

The amount field will default to the Estimated Expense amount, but it can be changed as needed. Once you save, you will see an Expense transaction on the record that will be cash impacting and will pull to your Form 5. The Estimated Expense associated with this Expense will no longer pull to the report.

# ABOUT POST ELECTION OR YEAR END WITH COLUMN C REPORTS

About Post-election or Year-End With Column C Reports
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees

Because the Post-Election Report date range has an election in the middle of the period, clients often get confused as to which Current Election to select and what date to supply as the Previous General Election Date when generating the report.

Our advice is:

* For the Previous General Election Date use an election date that corresponds to the Report From Date, rather than the election that happens during the period. You’ll want to ensure the Previous General Election Date is earlier than the Report From Date.
* However, for the Current Election use the election that happens during the report period.

After you generate your report and review the PDF, you may notice the summary pages for Lines 11 – 22 look pretty different. Typically there are two columns: Col A (Transactions in the Report) and Col B (Total of Transactions – Election Cycle To Date).

However, the report period for the Post-Election Report includes an Election, which the FEC uses to mark the end of an Election Cycle. This means the Post-Election Report covers two Election Cycles – the one that just ended at the Current Election, and the new one that started the day after the Current Election.

To accommodate this, the Post-Election has Column C, which is for that second cycle. This column is the Total of Transactions Election Cycle to Date for the new cycle that started the day after the Current Election to the end of the report.

How do these columns work together?
----------

* Column A is always the total of transactions in the period. This is the same, even on a Post-Election Report
* Column B is always the total of transactions in the election cycle. For the FEC, an election cycle starts the day after the previous General election. We use the date provided in the Previous General Election Date
* Column C is the total of transactions in the new election cycle, starting the day after the date of the election set as Current Election. This will include some transactions found in Column A

Is Column C only found on the Post-Election Report?
----------

Nope. In fact, Column C is found on 4 reports:

1. Post-General Report: This is used in conjunction with a Pre-General Report, and filed after the General Election. This is the most common usage of the Column C
2. Post-Special Report: This is used in conjunction with a Pre-Special Report, and filed after a Special Election
3. Post-Runoff Report: This is used in conjunction with a Pre-Runoff Report, and filed after a Runoff Election
4. Year-End with Column C: This is rarely used, and typically only per instruction by your FEC analyst. Using this reporting period will get Col C to reset the election cycle totals. This could be used if a candidate participated in the Primary Election, but did not continue on to the General Election

How do I do the math?
----------

Typically, on reports with just Columns A and B, the math is:

Previous Report Column B +
Current Report Column A =
————————————
Current Report Column B

However, with the Post-Election, the math is:

Previous Report Column B +
Current Report Column A =
————————————
Current Report Column B +
Current Report Column C

Of course, it wouldn’t be the FEC if there wasn’t yet another strange thing on the report. On the first summary page (Lines 6-10), the Column B figures do not cover totals through the end of the report as they do for most reports; they only cover through the General (Current) Election. The FEC has stressed they care more about the Election Cycle totals, rather than the To Date totals.

Please also note Column C is only found on the Form 3. Form 3X Filers also have to file a Post-Election, but the 3X does not have this special summary page with Col C. The 3X To/From Dates will be the same, as well as Current Election and Report Period.

# CREDIT CARD FAILURE CODES

Credit Card Failure Codes
==========

There may be times where a donor’s credit card contribution is rejected and the reason is just a code or phrase. Below are some of the codes and reasons for the card rejection.

**HOLD-CALL**: This essentially means the financial institution associated with the credit card did not accept the charge because the card was reported stolen, lost, or invalid. The term “HOLD-CALL” is an old retail phrase indicating to a cashier that they should not return the card to the person using it and call the financial institution. Obviously that’s a bit antiquated these days but the root cause is still the same.

**DECLINED**: The donation can be declined for several reasons. They include insufficient funds, invalid account, the provided address doesn’t match the billing address, or more.

**EXPIRED**: This is due to the card being expired or an attempt using a canceled card. Sometimes this can happen when attempting to issue a refund.

# WHAT ARE ALLOCATIONS HOW DO I USE THEM

What Are Allocations & How Do I Use Them?
==========

Some political organizations conduct both state and federal political activity and have separate arms to do this. In these cases, they’ll have one political committee registered with the FEC and one registered on the state level. This is most common for state and local party committees, but PACs can also do this.

When an organization has these two affiliated committees, they will have some expenses or fundraising that need to be shared between federal and non-federal filers. Typically it is expenses that are shared, but sometimes there are contributions (monetary and in-kind). Those expenses will be paid out of the federal account, then the state account will reimburse the federal account. There are a lot of rules on what is okay to share and what is not. Be sure to review the FEC rules regarding allocations carefully.

The Allocations option under the Accounting tab allows you to track, report, and properly enter allocation transfers between the two accounts.

What are the Allocation types?
----------

The expenses can be one of these Allocation Types:

* Administrative
* Direct Candidate Support
* Direct Fundraising
* Exempt
* Public Communications
* Voter Drive

The following 4 types are only used by Party Committees that have Levin Accounts.

* Generic Campaign Activity (Levin)
* GOTV (Levin)
* Voter ID (Levin)
* Voter Registration (Levin)

Some of the above Allocation Types have fixed ratios, depending on the type of election year the Allocation is used for.

* If both a presidential candidate and a Senate candidate appear on the ballot: 36%
* If a presidential candidate, but not a Senate candidate, appears on the ballot: 28%
* If a Senate candidate, but not a presidential candidate, appears on the ballot: 21%
* If neither a presidential candidate nor a Senate candidate appears on the ballot: 15%

Fixed Allocation Types are:

* Administrative
* Exempt
* Generic Campaign Activity (Levin)
* GOTV (Levin)
* Voter Drive
* Voter ID (Levin)
* Voter Registration (Levin)

The other 3 Allocation Types (Direct Candidate Support, Direct Fundraising & Public Communication) have a variable ratio and can be set as appropriate.

In ISP you can create allocations for use with transactions as well as indicate the Allocation Transfers from a non-federal account to a federal account to pay for the non-federal share of activity. Allocation activity is reported on the various Form 3x Schedule H sections.

Allocations usually need to be created each year or election cycle and reported on the first filing that period.

How do I create an Allocation?
----------

First, be sure your database is set up for Joint State/Federal Filing. Also confirm both the State and Federal Committees have Filer Committees set and each have at least one Financial Account. Once this has been confirmed, you can add Allocations to the database.

Select Allocations under the Accounting tab. On the resulting page, you’ll see any already existing Allocations showing. To add a new Allocation, click the Add Allocation button at the bottom of the screen. In the window that appears, complete the necessary fields.

**Allocation Type:** There are a number of different Allocation Types possible depending on the activity. The most common Allocation Type is Administrative.

**Fixed Allocation Ratio:** For most Allocation Types you will have several different fixed ratios to pick from. These ratios are set, depending on the type of federal elections going on that year.

Once you have an allocation created, you will see the allocation information listed on the Allocations page. To the far right next to the letter i is a stacked line icon. Mouse over that and you can see the totals of transactions using this allocation. If this is your first allocation, it will be all zeros. After adding a transaction with an allocation, you can come back here and see the impact applying an allocation will have.

How do I use an Allocation?
----------

Typically, Allocations are used on expenses. On rare occasions they are used on in-kind or monetary contributions. Our help file on[ Prohibited Inkind Contributions For Allocable Activities](https://ispolitical.com/prohibited-inkind-contributions-for-allocable-activities/) covers this.

When adding an expense, ensure the expense is associated with the Federal filer and you select the appropriate Allocation. When allocating for fundraising, allocations are used on contributions to determine the allocation percentage.

How do I add Allocations to transactions?
----------

After creating one or more allocations, you will see a new Allocation drop-down field available when entering transactions. Whenever you select an Allocation in the dropdown for a transaction, you are telling the system this is a transaction that needs to be on the Form 3X as allocated between federal and state funds. Only select an allocation if the transaction needs to be reported as shared. Otherwise, this field should be blank.

How do I indicate an Allocation Transfer of Funds?
----------

In addition to reported shared activity via allocations, you can also record and report allocation transfers from a non-federal financial account to a federal financial account to pay for the state share of any disbursements.

To add an Allocation Transfer, navigate to Accounting, then to Allocations. To the right of the Allocation, click the blue Add Allocation Transfer button you want to record a transfer for. A popup will appear with some fields that are very similar to an Internal Transfer transaction. Enter the details of the transfer, including the financial account the funds are going to and where they are from. This will create an Allocation Transfer transaction that will show on the register. In the non-federal financial account, it will appear as money out and in the federal financial account, it will appear as money in. This is the only type of transfer transaction that is reportable between financial accounts.

# NY COMMON IMPORT ERRORS

NY Common Import Errors
==========

Applies To: New York

When uploading your e-file to the state filing system, the importer will validate your e-file one line at a time. It is a time consuming process to go through so please make sure you have fully addressed all the errors and warnings generated by ISP before you upload your e-file.

However, there are some cases where ISP does not fully cover with error checking. Here are some common import errors and how to fix them.

**The Election Year (ELECT\_YEAR\_ID) does not match the value in Filing Period (ELECT\_YEAR\_ID) and Election (ELECT\_YEAR\_ID) OR Filing Period (FILING\_TYPE\_ID) and Election (ELECT\_TYPE\_ID) in #ROW 1.**

This error usually means that the Election and Report Period parameters on your report do not match up correctly. More often than not it’s the Election. Please make sure you have the correct Election chosen for the type of report you are trying to file. For Pre- and Post-Election reports, this means the Election parameter should be set to that election date AND election type. For periodic reports, the Election parameter should be set to the date of the regular election that took place during the reporting period and set to election type Other.

You should also ensure the Report Due Date is correctly set to the filing deadline.

**Error has occurred while importing the ExampleFileName.csv Row# XX, TRANS\_EXPLNTN.**

This error means one of your transactions should have a compliance note but doesn’t. There are many reasons for this but the likeliest causes are either (1) a transaction code used a reporting code that required further explanation, or (2) a transaction is missing a reported transaction method. In the case of #2, transactions without transaction methods are reported as an Other method which requires further explanation.

Unless the transaction method the transaction was made through is not supported on ISP, please make sure all your reported transactions have a transaction method listed.

**The Data in Row# XX is not placed correctly.**

99% of the time this means that there are commas used as part of an individual’s name. Please update the relevant entity record to remove it.

# ABOUT ORGANIZATION RECORDS

About Organization Records
==========

Entity records in ISP are designed to house numerous pieces of valuable information. Below is a breakdown of what you’ll find in an Organization record.

At the top of each record you’ll find basic information, such as the name and Business Type info. If there is any contribution information, you’ll see a wrench icon where you can choose to display Key Stats, such as Most Recent Contribution, Total Donations, and more. If contact information is available, such as Email or Phone, you’ll have options to call or email them directly, as well as view their address on a map.

If you need to make any edits to the name and other basic information, click on the green triangle in the top right corner to display a window where edits can be made.

In nearly all of the sections on the page, you’ll have the option to add information. Again, this done by clicking the green triangle in the right corner of the section. Some of these sections are Transactions, Flags, Relationships, and more.

If the organization is also known by abbreviation, like ISP vs Integrated Solutions: Political, use the Alias field. When someone searches for ISP instead of the full name, the record will be included in the search results.

If the organization is a committee, use the Committee Info section on the right to add information such as ID Number, Jurisdiction, and other committee-related information. This data can play an important role when it comes to Compliance reports, including any affiliations to their committee staff in the Relationships section.

At the bottom of the page, use the Advanced Tools drop-up menu to make the record Inactive or Delete the record. The Delete option will not be available when the record contains critical information, such as financial transactions, for example.

Finally, you can print the record details or export it to a Call Sheet using the Print/Export button at the very bottom of the screen.

# WHAT ARE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS AND HOW DO I ADD THEM

What Are Financial Accounts and How Do I Add Them?
==========

Financial Accounts allow you to keep track of which bank accounts all your transactions are in. Also, if you have multiple filers in your database, you can link accounts to certain filers to ensure transactions pull to the appropriate report.

Above the list of accounts on the Financial Accounts page are tabs.

**Active:** These are all active financial accounts in the database. If you attempt to remove an active account that has financial activity, the system will instead move it to the Inactive view.

**Inactive:** These are financial accounts not in use and removed from your active list of options to choose from.

# HOW DO I FILE A CA FORM 497

How Do I File a CA Form 497?
==========

Applies To: California

The CA Form 497 has two main uses:

* Primarily, a 24-hour Contribution Report, which is required for contributions received or non-independent expenditure made in the amount or aggregate of $1,000 or more, filed within the 90-day period before an election
* A 10-day report, required for contributions received or non-independent expenditures made in the amount or aggregate of $5,000 or more, filed anytime outside of the 90-day period before an election

Per the FPPC manual, if a committee receives a contribution after a 24-hour report is filed but that contribution amount does not reach the $1,000 threshold, another 24-hour report is not needed until that threshold is crossed again.

When generating a 497 in ISPolitical, navigate to Compliance under the Reporting tab. On the criteria screen you will see the following fields.

**Filer:** Ensure the correct filer is selected if you have more than one Filer. If you only have one Filer (most common), then you won’t see this option.

**Compliance Report:** Select the CA Form 497 from the listed report types.

**Compliance Report Version:** Along with the Standard version, choose from [various versions](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-ca-form-497-report) of the 497 report.

**Local Jurisdiction:** This limits the report to Support/Oppose memo entities to the local jurisdiction. This is used by committees who receive/make contributions in multiple jurisdictions, and need to restrict a report to a specific jurisdiction for filing purposes. This dropdown is commonly left blank.

**Current Election:** Select the current election the committee is participating in.

**From Date:** The From Date should always be the first day of the 90-day reporting period.

**To Date:** The To Date is the day you are running this report on.

If you are filing an amendment, check the Amended box. Two new fields will appear.

**Amended Compliance Report:** If you filed the original or previous 497 report outside of ISP, select the filed outside of ISP option. If you previously used your own random or preferred report number, select the option stating an optional number was used.

**Amendment Number:** Use this field to specify which amendment this is. For example, if you previously filed two amendments, enter in the number 3.

After you’ve completed the fields, click the Generate button to generate your report. When it completes the process, review your report and, when ready, click E-File Report to State to send it electronically to the state, or, if available E-File Report to Local Agency. After you receive the confirmation the report was accepted, click the Mark As Filed button.

Clicking the Mark As Filed button will mark all transactions in the report as previously reported. This prevents transactions from being double reported later and provides an extra layer of protection from editing or accidental deletion.

How are contribution conduits reported?
----------

For contributions received, when a transaction is received via conduit, California does not require all of the conduit information. All that pulls to the 497 is an automatically generated note that states the transaction was received via a conduit.

For contributions made, California is really only concerned about the end recipient, which is the entity associated with the Support/Oppose Memo. The report doesn’t even disclose the original/parent entity. This also means we do not pull an automatically generated note that states the transaction was made via conduit.

### How do I report In-Kind Contributions on the 497? ###

From a reporting perspective, in-kinds contributions are considered typical contributions. On the 497 report, the aggregate resets during the 90-day period.

Per the FPPC:

“A committee must file a Form 497 for each aggregated contribution of $1,000 or more from the same source. For example, if a committee reported a contribution of $2,000 on the Form 497 and later the same source made a $500 contribution, the Form 497 is not required as long as the contributor did not make future contributions that aggregated to $1,000 or more during the 90-day election cycle.“

While the above clause talks about Contributions Received, the concept is the same for Contributions Made.

# HOW DO I USE QUICK IMPORTS FOR WINRED TRANSACTIONS

How Do I Use Quick Imports for WinRed Transactions?
==========

There are two main ways to get WinRed data into your account in ISP. If you are not using the automatic WinRed integration, you can also use the Quick Import tool to achieve this goal.

### What is the difference between the automatic integration and Quick Imports for my WinRed data? ###

Simply put, the Quick Import tool is often faster to work with when you have large amounts of data. However, the Integration tool allows for real-time information to come in rather than having to upload batches on a regular basis. We have a separate help file for [installing the WinRed integration](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-the-winred-integration/).

### Quick Import Method ###

You can use Quick Imports to get your WinRed data in quickly. If you have not used it before, please contact Support and ask to install the import option in your database.

Once installed, go to the Quick Imports page under Tools, then select the WinRed option in the Format dropdown. On the right side of the screen, in the About section, it will explain which fields on your spreadsheet are required and which are optional.

You’ll also see a checkbox for Import as Conduit – Conduit Check Splits. When this box is checked, it will create a single transaction from WinRed on the Record Deposit screen with the entities as Splits. Each individual contribution that makes up that Conduit Check will have their own dates matching the data file.

If you have Agency fees as well as WinRed credit card transaction fees, both are taken out of the check you receive from WinRed. As a result, you will need to have two expenses added to the Batch Deposit. One for the processing fee and one for the agency fee. Both can be created the same way via Add Deducted Fees on the deposit screen.

# WHAT ARE TICKETS TICKET AREAS AND HOW DO I ADD THEM

What Are Tickets & Ticket Areas and How Do I Add Them?
==========

The Tickets tool gives you the ability to track and record any issues expressed to you by individuals and organizations. You can assign tickets to other staff users, as well as group similar ticket issues together.

Under the Tools tab, select Tickets. If you don’t see it as an option, select Add/Remove Tools, then scroll down to the Tickets option and click it to add it to your database.

If this is your first time using Tickets, you’ll first need to create a Ticket Area. These are required when creating Tickets.

How do I add a Ticket Area?
----------

On the main Tickets page, click the blue Ticket Areas button at the bottom of the screen. To add a Ticket Area, click the Add Ticket Area at the bottom of the screen. A window will appear and a Ticket Area Name field will appear. Add the name and click Add Ticket Area.

On the Ticket Areas page you’ll see three tabs: Active, Inactive, and All. These will show which Ticket Areas are still in use and active, which Ticket Areas have been moved to inactive, or a full display of all active and inactive Ticket Areas.

To delete a Ticket Area click the red X to the left of the Ticket Area Name. If that Ticket Area is already in use, it will be moved to Inactive.

Once you’ve added the Ticket Area you’d like to use for Tickets, click the blue Manage Tickets button at the bottom of the page. This will return you back to the main Tickets page.

How do I add a Ticket?
----------

When you land on the Tickets page, you’ll see five tabs.

**Mine: Open:** This will show any Tickets you have assigned to you that are still open and pending.

**Unassigned: Open:** These are Tickets that are still open but yet to be assigned to any staff database users.

**All Open:** This is where all open Tickets regardless of status will be.

**Mine: Open & Closed:** This allows you to see all open and closed Tickets that are or were assigned to you.

**All: Open & Closed:** This will show all Tickets that have been created in the database, both open and closed statuses.

To add a Ticket, click the Add Ticket button at the bottom of the screen. A window will appear and allow you to add Ticket details.

**Subject:** This is the name of the Ticket and/or a general idea of what the Ticket is about.

**Description:** Use this text field to describe the issue at hand. You have various text editing options, as well.

**Ticket Area:** This is a list of the Ticket Areas created previously and determine where the issue is.

**Entity:** This is the individual or organization that alerted you or the staff to the issue.

**Assigned To:** You can use this to assign the ticket to a particular staff member that uses ISP.

Once these fields and options have been filled out and selected, click the Add Ticket button to add the new Ticket, or the Add & New button to add the Ticket and clear out the fields to create a new Ticket.

What else can I do with the Ticket?
----------

If you click the name of the Ticket, you’ll arrive on a new screen. This will allow you to quickly update who it’s assigned to, what Ticket Area it’s in, as well as the description.

To the right will be the Entity and basic details from their record. You can make edits to their record’s details, if needed.

At the bottom of the screen are various options.

**Close Ticket:** Click this to close the Ticket.

**Add Update:** If you’d like to add an update to the ticket, click this button. A new window will appear and contain a text field where you can add an update. That will then appear in the Updates section above and display both the update and the date of the update.

**Email:** To email the entity directly, use this option.

You can also click the blue button to navigate directly to the Entity’s record.

To return to the list of Tickets, click the List button at the bottom of the screen.

# HOW DO I ADD NEW TRANSACTIONS

How Do I Add New Transactions?
==========

Keeping track of your financial status is an important part of any campaign. That’s why it’s essential to know which transaction to enter into ISP and how to add them.

There are two ways you can add a transaction to the system.

### Entity Record ###

Both Individual and Organization records contain a Transactions section. Click the add icon (green plus sign) in the top right corner of the Transactions section header to add a new transaction.

### Accounting Tab ###

Under the Accounting tab, select Add Transaction.

To start, click the Type drop-down menu to see your list of transaction types to choose from. We’ve also given each [transaction type its own color](https://ispolitical.com/color-changes-on-the-add-transaction-screen/).

There are many transaction types to choose from, whether it’s a [Loan](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-loan-repayment-or-forgiveness/) or [Inkind](https://ispolitical.com/how-to-record-in-kind-made-transactions/). However, two of the more common transaction types used are Expenses and Monetary Contributions, including [contributions to other committees](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-contribution-to-other-committees/). Within these transactions are places for [Splits/Memos](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-memos-splits-and-how-do-i-add-them/) and also for [transaction Tags](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-transaction-tags-and-how-do-i-use-them/).

### Date ###

This field will automatically populate with the current date. If the transaction occurred on a different date, you can either manually type in the date of the transaction or use the calendar option to the right of the field to select a date.

### Account ###

This field determines which account the funds are either going to (Receipt) or being removed from (Disbursement). If the transaction is a receipt and it has not yet been deposited into an actual account, select Undeposited and it will be placed in a pool of other transactions where you can then deposit them – either per transaction or in batches.

Please be aware that Accounts are also tied to the filing committee used for compliance reporting. This can also have an effect on other fields:

### Election ###

This field is very important, as it has an effect on aggregate thresholds and compliance reporting. When adding a transaction, if you receive a warning that the transaction would cross the aggregate threshold, please check this field and ensure the correct election is selected.

### Reporting Code (Expenses only) ###

The list of options here will be determined by the Account (and filing committee) selected above. Each filing agency has their own set of Reporting Codes and these can play a large part in determining which line of the report the transaction will pull to.

### Compliance Note ###

This field allows you the ability to provide further details about the transaction to the filing agency. Not all transactions require a Compliance Note, as it can depend on the filing agency’s guidelines, but the following transaction types generally require this: Expenses, Accrued Expenses, Non-Monetary Expenses, and In-kind Contributions. If you are unsure if this is required, please consult your filing agency’s guidebook or contact them for further direction.

### Budget Category ###

These are used to help you track transactions and sort transactions. If you do not see one that applies, select Uncategorized or a temporary placeholder until you can create one that is more applicable and return to the transaction to use the intended Budget Category.

There are various other fields that will appear depending on the transaction type. One transaction type, the Internal Transfer, has fewer fields than other transaction types but does have fields others don’t: the To Account and From Account fields. The Internal Transfer allows you to track any funds that were moved between accounts found in your database.

When you are ready to add the transaction to the system, click the Add Transaction button. Clicking the Save & New button will add the transaction and clear out most fields for you to add another transaction, if you have more to add.

Some fields are what we call sticky fields, meaning the next time you return to add a transaction, the same information will appear. This includes the Transaction Type, Account, Election, and Budget Category.

If the transaction is over any set [transaction limits](https://ispolitical.com/transaction-limits/), you will receive an alert at the top of the screen.

If you are unsure about how to add a specific transaction type not discussed above, visit our help file on [unusual transactions](https://ispolitical.com/Entering-Unusual-Transactions/) and how to create those in ISP.

# HOW DO I FILE A CA AMENDMENT

How Do I File a CA Amendment?
==========

Applies To: California

Filing an amendment for your CA report is done on the same page you generated the original.

First, under the Reports tab, select Compliance Reports. Change the Compliance Report drop down to the CA report you’re amending, then complete the fields using data from the original report criteria. Check the Amended box. Three new fields will appear:

**Amended Compliance Report:** This dropdown allows you to choose the report you are amending. If it was filed outside of the system, select Filed Outside of ISP.

**Original Filing ID (local only):** If you are a local filer, add the original filing ID of the report you’re amending here. This will likely be a 6-10 digit number.

**Number of Amendments:** If you have filed multiple amendments, enter the number of amendment this would be. For example, if you’ve filed two amendments to this report, enter 3 in this field.

After completing the remaining necessary fields, click the Generate button at the bottom of the screen.

When the report generates and you’ve corrected errors or warnings, if any, click the E-File Report button at the bottom of the screen. On the resulting screen, enter your e-filing password. This password is provided to you by the state and is not the password you use to log in to the ISP system. Also on this screen, you’ll be asked to provide your Original Filing ID. This is the ID assigned to the original filing. If you’d like to save the password for future e-filings, click the Save to Password Safe box.

After entering in your password & Original Filing ID, click the Submit E-File button at the bottom.

# ABOUT THE NJ FORM R1 48HR REPORT

About the NJ Form R1 48HR Report
==========

Applies To: New Jersey

The NJ Form R-1 48HR Report generates a 48-Hour Notice for Contributions and/or Expenditures in excess of the reporting threshold starting with the 13th day prior to the election up to, and including, the day of the election. The reporting threshold is $1,900. If this is not the threshold you’re expecting, please contact Support.

When generating, set the From Date as the 13th day prior to the election you are reporting for. That way, the report will be able to accurately take into account the aggregate amount to one source during the 48-hour notice period.

To file, download the generated file and extract the CSVs from the zip folder. Then login to your [state account](https://www.njelecefile.com/Account/LoginAndRegister2) and use the Upload Manager to import your transactions. Due to e-filing limits, you will need to edit each transaction to mark them as a 48-Hour transaction once you have finished uploading.

# WHY WE DONT CALL OUR CLIENTS USERS

Why We Don’t Call our Clients “Users”
==========

<img alt="Group 341@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-341@2x.png" title="Group 341@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

It isn’t uncommon for software companies to call their clients “users,” since, well…they “use” their products. But that seems pretty robotic, doesn’t it? I mean, because you’re a person, not a user. You could be a mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, aunt, or even that crazy uncle most people only see at Thanksgiving. You’re human. You have emotions. You get angry. You get frustrated. You can be happy. You can be sad. You like and dislike things. When you walk through a park on a sunny day, you smell the grass, feel the sun gently heating your skin. You’re human. Guess what? We’re humans too! That’s a lot we have in common!

Why Do Software Companies Call You a “User”?
----------

So why do other software companies call you a user? It’s easy. When you’re talking to a software developer, it’s simple to say the ‘user’ does this. They probably don’t know who Kelly, Natalie, Christina, Laura, Jason, Kevin, or Tom are. Because developers aren’t exactly expected to have “people skills,” they rarely talk to their clients. There’s a gap between you and the person building your software. The developers don’t know your name or who you are or how many kids you have. This gap creates a tremendous problem that will significantly set back all hopes of user-friendly software design.

Even the staff charged with relaying your feedback to developers (assuming the company cares about your feedback) will call you ‘user’ instead of your name. At more abstract levels, when designing new functionality from scratch, a developer will use the vague concept of ‘user’ to map out the user interface. Since the developer doesn’t know his clients, doesn’t know their names, what else does he/she have to go by? They use a vague concept. They build software for ‘users’ instead of software for humans. Seems understandable enough, right?

Why Software Developers Should Program For People
----------

What’s the big deal if a developer thinks of a user instead of a person? Many companies don’t see any issue with designing software for users. It gets the job done. The software performs the task required. But here’s the thing; it’s software for a user, not a person. And software made for a user tends to suck. It sucks because a user is not a person.

A user is a vague concept. It’s bland, inhuman, humdrum, robotic, inorganic, and lifeless. A user performs a task. A user has no life, nothing else they’d rather do, nothing else they must do. A user has no other priorities than using the software, completing individual tasks as conceived of in the imagination of a developer.

Think of it this way, a developer writes code for one little piece of the entire system at a time. If they write this code for a user, they will consider only how to accomplish it. Because a user is inanimate, they only care that something can get done. They don’t care how it gets done. And that is a big, big deal. Because a user won’t complain. A user won’t throw a computer out a window when the user has to click a completely useless button 500 times. A user won’t smile when something goes right. A user won’t dole out any social consequences (no frowns, no bad reviews, no crossed arms, no frustrated sighs, no angry remarks) or rewards (no smiles, no hugs, no ‘thank you’s, no excellent reviews, no referrals, and etc.).

So there’s no social pressure on the developer to go the extra mile, to reduce friction, to make sure the task gets completed in the most efficient and pleasant way possible. When a developer builds software for a user, you get software built for a user. Humans rarely like this kind of software.

Humans hate this kind of software precisely because it’s not designed for them. It’s a subtle point with staggering consequences. A person simply is not a user. You are vibrant, have feelings, are guided by them. You get impatient. You smile. You frown. You have a million ways of letting people know whether you’re happy or angry. A good support and development staff will remember these signals and get better at interpreting them over time. And the surest way to guarantee that is to use real names.

A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet
----------

That’s why ISP uses names when we design our [campaign software](https://ispolitical.com/about/). Because the moment we do, a world of social pressures in an imaginary landscape emerges where we begin to envision your smile or frown. When we use your name, we have a better sense of what will make you happy or frustrated. We literally imagine you sitting in front of a desk for hours, plugging away at your work. We know you have kids to pick up from school, we know their names. We know you have fundraisers, campaign managers, and candidates who need reports. We know their names. We know the kind of pressure they put on you to hurry or to produce a different report type. We know you’re dreaming of getting out of the office and home to your family. We know you want to finish reports faster to take on more business, so you can buy a house. We know how happy you’ll be when you can.

Software is Built to Help HUMANS
----------

This is the point: the goal of software isn’t to complete a task, it’s to get you what you want overall, to satisfy what you want as a person. In this mental landscape, your personal goals form a crushing pressure on our software and mold it into something more comprehensive than a bunch of discrete functions that complete individual tasks. You get software made for you; a person.

That’s why ISP doesn’t say ‘user.’ We call you by your name. If you ask for something, we say you asked for it. Our developers know who our clients are. They see their feedback. They’ve learned about them. When they hear your name, they are no longer just completing a task. When they hear your name, they know they’re building for you. They know they’re building software for humans.

Call it bedside manner or call it the human touch, at ISP, our coders and programmers have real people in mind when they are working their magic. They put themselves in the shoes of Holly, Josh, Thomas and Katherine….all working on reports and budgets, all with other things on their minds as well. This way, we can better understand your pain points and what you want out of an accounting software. Do you love being treated like a person even if you’re just “using” a program? We thought so!

Have you found yourself frustrated at the countless administrative tasks that political campaigns involve? From data entries to database maintenance, all these menial tasks are not only time-consuming but can also be error-prone. However, with the integration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools, ISP revolutionized political campaign accounting by offering features that eliminate busy work, reduce errors, and streamline database management, all while keeping your campaigns transparent, compliant and thriving. Let’s take a look at the capabilities of ISP's AI assistant, a powerful tool designed to tackle mundane tasks, ensure compliance, and manage databases efficiently.

Standardization: A Cleaner Database at Your Fingertips
----------

Data consistency is crucial for any political campaign. With numerous contacts, zip codes, and phone numbers to manage, maintaining a standardized database can be daunting. This is where ISP's AI Assist comes into play. The AI Standardization feature automatically cleans up non-standard occupations and employers, as well as incorrect zip codes and phone numbers, ensuring that your records are accurate and uniform.

AI Assist's capabilities extend beyond basic standardization. It allows for customization, matching the preferred standards of each campaign, thereby reducing manual adjustments and freeing up your time for more pressing matters.

Combating Duplicates with AI Precision
----------

Duplicate records can clog up any database, making it cumbersome to manage and prone to errors. ISP's AI Assist offers a comprehensive solution to this problem. The tool automatically identifies and removes most duplicates, saving you time and effort. For potential duplicates that require human intervention, ISP's duplicates search tool facilitates quick reviews and efficient merging of records, ensuring a streamlined database.

This combination of automatic and manual review systems makes ISP's AI Assist one of the best AI tools for political campaigns, minimizing database clutter and enhancing data integrity.

Alerts for Timely Compliance
----------

Staying compliant with rules and deadlines is paramount for political campaigns, yet it's easy to overlook essential filings in the midst of busy schedules. Even the dreaded “Late Contribution Report,” can sometimes be forgotten. ISP's AI Assist eliminates this concern by offering an AI-powered alerts system. This feature understands late contribution report deadlines and automatically sends email reminders, ensuring your filings are submitted on time.

The AI Assist acts like a vigilant virtual assistant, reducing the risk of missed deadlines and helping campaigns maintain compliance effortlessly.

AI Virtual Assistant for Occupation and Employer Emails
----------

Tracking and updating occupations and employers for each campaign donor is another tedious task that AI Assist simplifies. The AI virtual assistant automatically sends emails to gather missing information, keeping track of each email sent and seamlessly updating records upon receiving responses. No other political accounting software had an AI assistant.

This feature effectively minimizes manual data entry, making ISP's AI Assist an invaluable asset for managing campaign databases and ensuring accuracy in donor information.

Seamless Imports for Online Donations
----------

Another key feature of ISP's AI Assist is its ability to handle online donations with ease. The AI automatically reviews and imports incoming donations into the matching records, simplifying the integration process. If a match isn't immediately clear, AI Assist alerts the user, allowing for manual confirmation.

This automation significantly reduces the workload associated with processing donations, making campaign management more efficient and accurate.

FAQs
----------

**How does ISP's AI Assist handle sensitive donor data securely?**

ISP's software uses industry-standard encryption to protect donor data. All information is securely stored, and access is restricted based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive information. This secure design helps maintain donor confidence and protects against data breaches.

**How does ISP's AI Assist integrate with other campaign management tools?**

ISP's software offers seamless integration with other campaign management tools. This integration ensures that data flows smoothly between different tools, reducing manual data entry and improving overall efficiency.

**What kind of support is available for users of ISP's AI Assist?**

ISP provides comprehensive support to users of its software paying over $100 per month. This includes a knowledge base with detailed guides and tutorials (for all clients), email support for specific inquiries, and phone support for urgent issues. This support network ensures that users can effectively utilize ISP's AI Assist and resolve any issues they encounter.

**How does ISP's AI Assist help campaigns stay up to date with compliance regulations?**

ISP's software includes regular updates to reflect changes in campaign finance regulations based on national and state changes. The AI Assist also provides real-time alerts for compliance-related tasks, helping campaigns stay current with filing deadlines and reporting requirements, and reducing the risk of regulatory violations.

Do You Have an AI Assistant?
----------

ISP's AI Assist is changing political campaign management by offering tools that streamline administrative tasks, maintain database integrity, and ensure compliance. From automatic standardization and duplicate removal to alerts for filings and efficient handling of online donations, these AI capabilities transform the way campaigns operate. By integrating these features, ISP's software has become an indispensable resource for campaign teams, reducing busy work, eliminating errors, and enabling political professionals to focus on what matters most—winning elections.

# WHAT ARE FLAGS AND HOW DO I USE THEM

What Are Flags and How Do I Use Them?
==========

Flags give you more control over how to separate, record, and keep track of how an individual or an organization is helping with the campaign. For example, if an entity is a Volunteer for the campaign, you can add the Volunteer Flag to their record.

Adding a Flag can be done by navigating to the record that you want to add the Flag to. In the Flags section header, click on the green triangle on its right side. In the Add Flags window, click in the Flag field. From the drop-down menu, click on the desired flag name; you may simultaneously add multiple Flags. Once the Flag has been selected, click on the green Add Flags button. You will now see the Flag in the record. Deleting a Flag is even simpler than adding one. Once you delete a Flag, it will be removed from all records; if that Flag is in use, then it will become Inactive. To delete a Flag or make a Flag Inactive, you just need to click on the red X.

You can search by Flags in Advanced Search to gather a list of records based on a particular Flag. This generated list can then be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for your convenience.

Flags are customizable with images. They can be decided from the pre-loaded images, or you can choose to leave them blank. The image will appear on the record of the entity.

# HOW DO I ADD REIMBURSEMENTS TO PERSONAL EXPENSES FOR OREGON COMPLIANCE REPORTS

How Do I Add Reimbursements to Personal Expenses for Oregon Compliance Reports?
==========

Applies To: Oregon

If you have a reimbursement on a personal expense, Oregon requires this to be reported in a specific way. Per the guide, there should be two transactions on the report to reflect the reimbursement.

1. Create the personal expense by adding an Accrued Expense with the Tag: Personal to the individual being reimbursed. For the specific expenses involved, add those as Splits.
2. Add an [Accrued Expense Payment](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-full-or-partial-payment-to-an-accrued-expense/) to the Accrued Expense you just created.

A very important part of this process is adding the Tag: Personal to the original Accrued Expense. If this is not added, the reimbursement will not report correctly.

# HOW DO I ADD INTERNATIONAL ADDRESSES TO ISP

How Do I Add International Addresses to ISP?
==========

Adding an international address from outside of the United States requires steps that are typically guided by how they should appear on compliance reports.

If you are a FEC filer, they recommend leaving the State field blank and putting the City, Country, and other information in the Address Line 2 field. When you generate your report, you’ll most likely receive a warning in our system, and also from the FEC, but this can be ignored. They are aware of these types of situations and again, this is their data entry recommendation.

If you file with a State or Local agency, these can be very specific to the agency itself. Please contact either the agency or Support for further help with the data entry.

There is an International Addresses tool in ISP that allows you to add addresses from numerous countries around the world. This is considered a Premium tool, so adding it to your account will increase your billing rate.

# ABOUT THE FEC FORM 5 REPORT

About the FEC Form 5 Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The Form 5 is only filed by Non-Committee filers. For Political Committee filers, use the [Form 24-IE](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-24-ie-report/) or the [Form 48-IE](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-48-ie-report/).

The FEC Form 5 Report is for reporting independent expenditures made and contributions received to be used by persons other than political committees. Independent expenditures aggregating in excess of $250 in a calendar year must report on this report. In order for these reports to work, both Expenses and Estimated Expenses need Support/Oppose Memos with either IE to Support or IE to Oppose.

Note that if a transaction has been reported on a Form 3/3x that has been marked as filed, that transaction will not pull to a Form 5.

Version Differences
----------

* **24-Hour Report:** Persons who make independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more towards a given election after the 20th day but more than 24 hours before the day of the election must file this version.
* **48-Hour Report:** Persons who make independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more towards a given after-election outside of the 20 days before an election must be reported on this report.

# HOW DO I GENERATE CALL SHEETS

How Do I Generate Call Sheets?
==========

Call Sheets allow you to have campaign donor information in front of you when calling potential contributors, including both contact information and donation information.

There are two ways you can generate Call Sheets, either from within an individual record or in bulk.

### Individual ###

If you only need a Call Sheet for a single individual, navigate to that entity’s record and click the Print/Export button at the bottom of the screen. Select Generate Call Sheet. This will create a PDF and begin the download process.

### In Bulk ###

If you need to contact multiple potential campaign donors, you can generate Call Sheets in bulk. This can be done on the Quick Lists page under the Reports tab.

When you arrive on that screen, select Call Sheets from the Format drop down. You also have a Target drop down that allows you to target specific donors. The default is All, which is every individual in your database, or you can target potential donors based on record type (Individual, Organization, or Political Committee) or other pieces of information found in the record.

If you’d like to filter the results to get them as specific as possible, you can use the Filter By Giving History section. These options are based on financial data specific to transactions, including which Financial Account transactions are in or a Date or Amount range.

You also have the option of excluding certain entities from the list, either by Communication or Flag.

### Key Stats ###

Key Statistics are important points of financial data that allow you to quickly view and ascertain transaction history, as well as provide insight into donation trends.

To select the four Key Stats you’d like to show on the Call Sheet, on the right side of the screen is an Included Key Stats section. Here you can drag and drop your choices to the top four items. These will display on the Call Sheet from left to right in the order you have them numbered.

When ready, click the Submit button at the bottom of the screen and the call sheets will generate into PDFs you download and save to your computer.

==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

When [Allocations](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-Allocations-How-Do-I-Use-Them/) are created in the system, they will pull to the FEC Form 3X report. However, the specific report location will depend on the data entry used to create the Allocation types.

# HOW ARE REFUNDED CONTRIBUTIONS REPORTED ON WA C4 PDC VS SEATTLE

How Are Refunded Contributions Reported on WA C4 PDC vs Seattle?
==========

Applies To: Washington

There are two different C4 (Ballot/Candidate/Non-Candidate) reports, a PDC version and a Seattle version. How Refunded Contributions pull to each will vary.

The C4 distinguishes between receipt starting totals and expense starting totals.

The PDC considers a Refunded Contribution an Expense, making it part of the expense starting totals. This means, on the PDC Form C4, Refunded Contributions are listed as an Expense once and only once on Schedule A3.

However, Seattle considers a Refunded Contribution to have a negative impact on the receipt totals.

On the Seattle Form C4, this is accomplished by Refunded Contributions are listed three times:

* On Schedule A3 as an Expense
* On Schedule C1 as a Contribution correction
* On Schedule C2 as an Expense correction

What this does is essentially *move* the transaction:

* Listing the Refunded Contribution as an Expense because the filer sent money out
* Listing it as Expense correction to remove it from the Expense side
* Listing it as a Receipt correction to move it to the Receipt side

# HOW DO I COMBINE DUPLICATES

How Do I Combine Duplicates?
==========

The Combine Duplicates page allows you to view potential duplicates in your database using various search criteria. You can then determine whether you want to combine them, as well as customize what data is merged, or determine if the two records listed are not duplicates.

Under the Tools tab, select Combine Duplicates. To start, choose which method you’re going to use to find potential duplicates. Your method sets the way the system looks for record matches. Click the Change Method button at the bottom of the screen.

### How do I change the method to search for potential duplicates? ###

The Change Method button will open a new window where you choose various pieces of data to locate duplicates.

**Entity Type:** This drop down menu determines which record type the system will be combing through. Your options are All, Individual, or Organizations.

**Name Match:** When the system matches by name, you can have it search using different levels of strictness. These levels are A+, A, B, and C. Each level determines just how broad the system looks for duplicates. The A+ level will be much more strict than the C level. You’ll also see with each level, a small description will appear below the dropdown and explain what the level is looking for.

Please keep in mind Prefixes and Suffixes when expecting results, as these can come into play when determining potential duplicates.

**Contact Information:** This dropdown determines which piece of contact information to couple with the Name Match. This allows you to search by Name or Address or other items such as Occupation or Employer or Email Address.

In this window you’ll also have the options of limiting results to only records that contain transactions, as well as excluding any entities previously marked as not a duplicate.

Once you’ve determined your search methods, click the Update button. The system will then conduct the search for potential duplicates and display them on the screen.

When your results appear, you will see three columns: Record, Potential Duplicate, and Options. The Record and Potential Duplicate columns will display what the system found, both the record and the other record it has deemed a possible duplicate.

The system will not combine duplicates when both records have candidate information. This is because the system has no way of knowing what candidate information to keep.

### What options do I have when combining duplicates? ###

The Options column provides three different options: Combine, Not a Duplicate, and Customize. The Combine button will simply combine the two records and the Not a Duplicate button will mark the Potential Duplicate record as not a duplicate and it will no longer appear in search results if you select to not display them.

**Customize:** The Customize option allows you to both add and determine the data you want to show in that record, as well as choosing which data points are Primary. If the Record and Potential Duplicate have different data points for Email, Phone, and Mailing/Reporting Addresses, you’ll have the option of determining which remain the Primary choice when the records are combined into one.

### What is Universal Geographic ID? ###

ISP automatically uses a geographic database to assign Universal Geographic IDs to your addresses. This is an ongoing background job. Using the Universal Geographic ID searches will allow you to match people even if the address is entered in different formats.

### Where did the Combine All button go? ###

If you have a large list of results, it can be time consuming to combine duplicates one at a time. At the bottom of the screen you may see a Combine All button. We definitely urge you to use some caution when using this button but it will allow you to combine the results in one fell swoop.

There may be times, however, where you don’t see the Combine All button. Currently Combine All will be available for A and A+ matches with concrete contact information such as Email, Phone, or Address. The Combine All option is not available for lower level search options as this leaves too much room for error.

### Is there another way to combine duplicates? ###

This help file is for the Combine Duplicates page under Tools. However, you can also [combine duplicates from the Individual/Organization search screen](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-combine-duplicates-in-search-results/).

# 7 WAYS TO MAKE FILING DEADLINES PAINLESS

7 Ways to Make Filing Deadlines Painless
==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

We all have those horrible, awful days. Days where every single client you have turns their finance reports in at once-the January 31st kind of days. Days where you're not sure if more caffeine will make your hands shake too much to type, and if that shaking is worth it to keep your eyes from shutting completely.

Well, at least I did.

That's why I've put together a list of ideas for campaign filing deadlines to make your life much, much easier on those dreadful days-or at least less painless than the dentist's office. Let's take a look…

### 1. Don't do all of your data entry at once. ###

Procrastinating or letting things pile up have the same ill-effect. By filing daily (or at least weekly), you create a more manageable filing schedule. You don't want to be running around in panic at the filing deadline, doing work that could have been accomplished weeks ago. How do I know? I've been there. But think about how much less stress you'll feel as the days tick toward a filing deadline without a backlog! Enter checks as they come in…you'll thank my for it!

### 2. Do your bank reconciliations monthly. ###

This one hits home. The first campaign I ever worked on, I had to file three amendments to the FEC, all because I didn't stay up on my reconciliations. Reconciliations are easy, and maybe even a little therapeutic-making everything match is not an issue you want to deal with while you've got other things going on.

So, like keeping up with your filings to spread your workload out more evenly, the same goes for your reconciliations. Even more important: make sure you're doing your bank reconciliations in the same software you use to generate your compliance reports. If you miss this critical point, doing reconciliations at all is useless! Luckily, we offer [software](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/) that does both.

### 3. Generate drafts of your report before the period has even closed. ###

Creating drafts of your compliance reporting early and often is a real lifesaver. That's why we built [software](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/) that makes it incredibly easy to do! When you create a draft report with our software, it performs over 5,000 error checks to make sure all the kinks are ironed out. It looks for transcription errors, missing addresses, employers, misclassified entities-basically, whenever you generate a report, our software checks every aspect and makes it easy for you to fix it!

If you run drafts early and often, when the filing deadline comes along, you should only have a few weeks of errors to fix (instead of a few months). It's all about maintenance!

### 4. Generate a draft report as soon as the period ends. ###

Generating reports as soon as they are available adds a super fast and easy way to do some maintenance that saves time down the road. Get in there early to check that dates and amounts are correct, focusing specifically on starting and ending balances, so you can catch inconsistencies early on. Get a jump on the little things so you can relax while the rest of the companies are stressing.

### 5. Save for filing-courtesy of yours truly. ###

When you generate a report, you can save it into our system for later. This makes filing day a whole lot easier: you can pre-generate reports and keep them all in one place, saving as you go. If something bad happens (maybe something you can blame on the intern), it won't affect your whole report, because **you** were smart enough to use software that corrects all the mistakes **I** used to make!

We have a special tool just for consultants too. With this tool, you can update reports for every client you represent as filings come in, and keep them all in the same place. Every saved report appears on one screen, organizing all the reports you have to file, for all of your clients.

Even better, on filing day you can submit all of your reports from that same screen, going down the screen, one-by-one, until your job is done! I know how hard it is to keep everything straight, which is why I built something that helps you do just that.

### 6. Still-seriously-don't wait until last minute! ###

Our software is state of the art, responsive, and designed to work reliably and efficiently for you. The FEC's is not.

It's tough to imagine, but filing agency employees are probably just as stressed out as we are come deadline time. And unfortunately, while you're used to using software that's the best of the best (*cough* ours), they're probably still using decades old software loaded on floppy disks. This means their servers can run slow or even become unresponsive as the end of filing day approaches. Needless to say, that isn't a headache you want to go through.

Try and file in the morning, *just in case*. This will be easy if you use our software, and will help you avoid catastrophes.

### 7. Have a cocktail at lunch ###

This is the most important step! You did it. Now you get to sit back and laugh as other firms (who didn't follow our advice, or use our software) struggle and worry throughout the day. Good job.

Ready to Ditch Campaign Filing Deadline Headaches Forever?
----------

As you can see, a big part of reducing the pains of campaign filing deadlines is daily and monthly maintenance. The other part that makes that maintenance simple, fast, and easy, is using ISPolitical software. All the necessary checklist items are accounted for and at your fingertips. We help you to dot your i's and cross your t's…all you have to do is a little maintenance to stay on top!

# WHY ARE DASHBOARD KEY STATS DIFFERENT THAN LINE 11 TOTALS ON FEC REPORTS

Why Are Dashboard Key Stats Different Than Line 11 Totals on FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The Key Stats on the Dashboard reflect a more specified breakdown of contributions as they are entered. This will most likely differ from Line 11 on your FEC report, as that total will reflect a value that may also contain deductions or fee expenses that will reduce the initial total of the contributions.

# WHY EMAILS MAY BOUNCE WONT SEND OUT

Why Emails May Bounce/Won’t Send Out
==========

Sometimes emails may bounce or they may not even send out. Here are some reasons why this might potentially occur:

1. Legal requirements and restrictions on sending a broadcast to .gov and a few other domains will result in some email being filtered out automatically prior to sending.
2. Any potential domains or emails that have been flagged as “poison pill” emails will be automatically filtered out.
3. Any fake emails will be removed and won’t be able to send out. For example “Fake@123.n” or a similar address is not real.
4. Transient bounces are pretty common. This is when emails didn’t make it to their destination because they were either held up by another email server on the internet, are bad emails that the email server didn’t indicate as such, or some unknown routing problem. These are hard to resolve completely because they exist outside of the broadcast email servers.
5. Depending on people’s email settings, they may have a filter (or email tools) that drop broadcast emails automatically (or the email server might do it). Others will get the email, but it’ll end up in spam. The broadcast email provider does their best to prevent that, but it’s impossible to prevent at least some from ending up in spam, even with a valid SPF and verified email.

# HOW DO I CREATE AND MANAGE CUSTOM EXPORTS

How Do I Create and Manage Custom Exports?
==========

For those who want more control over data exported from the database, you can design your own export formats by choosing from dozens of fields using the Custom Exports tool.

How do I create and manage a custom export?
----------

You can access the Manage Custom Exports page via three different pages: Thank Donors, Advanced Search, and Financial Reports. At the bottom of each of those pages is a blue Manage Custom Exports button.

On the Custom Exports page, click the green Add Custom Export Format at the bottom of this page to create a new export format. This will open a new window that will ask you to name your Custom Export.

You’ll also have the options of where the Custom Exports will be available in the database. The three options are the same pages mentioned above: Advanced Search, Thank Donors, and Financial Reports.

One thing to keep in mind when using Custom Exports with Advanced Search is the results will include all transactions found within a record when the Custom Export includes fields related to transactions. However, when Custom Exports are used with other transaction reports, the results will simply be the type of transactions found within the search details.

After you’ve chosen which pages to include the custom export you’re creating, select the Area from the dropdown menu. These options include:

* Addresses
* Communications
* Elections
* Emails
* Entities
* Flags
* Households
* Key Stats
* Phones
* Pledges & Targets
* Political Districts
* Relationships
* Transactions

Below the dropdown are two columns, Available and Selected. The Available will populate based on the Area option you choose. The Selected column will show your choices for the columns you want on your custom export.

To add them to the Selected column, drag each desired block from the Available column to the Selected column or click the arrow next to the Available option. If you want your columns to be in a specific order, drag them up or down.

When you have the desired columns and in the order you want, click the green Add Custom Export Format at the bottom.

On the main Custom Exports page, you’ll also have an option at the bottom to Add From Other Accounts. If you work in or manage other databases, you can add custom exports in those databases to the one you’re currently working in.

After logging in, you should see a menu on the left side of the screen. If you don’t see it, hit the Menu button on the top right or the Expand bar on the left.

Next, select the Upload Transactions from Spreadsheets option under Step 1. This takes you to where you can upload your Excel file.

Upload your file and select the proper Filing Period and the Transaction Type, then click Upload. You will need to do this twice: once for Receipts and once for Expenses.

Once both Upload Statuses show they were processed without error, you can file your report using the Menu option under Step 2.

Before you continue filing, be aware that some of your transactions might need to filed directly on the state’s website. These include:

* New commercial loans
* Loan payments
* Returned receipts
* Payments of incurred obligations

How do I submit the report?
----------

Once all your transactions have been uploaded, you can look through all of your Expenses and Contributions on the File Report page.

Using the filters, you can search for specific transactions to review or file separately. Otherwise, there are options to preview your Finance Report or to file it with the state.

After choosing to file your report with the state, enter the requested authorizations in the new fields and verify that the reported cash balances are correct. Once you’ve done so, click Submit to finish filing the report.

How do I file an amendment?
----------

To create an amendment, click the Amend a Filed Report option on the state website’s menu. You can use the search tools to check if something has already been filed and you can use the various buttons at the bottom to input a new transaction if it hasn’t.

# HOW DO I ENTER RETURNED CHECKS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDS

How Do I Enter Returned Checks Due to Insufficient Funds?
==========

The data entry for returned checks due to insufficient funds is not the typical refund creation process.

First, from within the same entity record, create a second contribution transaction with the same amount. The date should be the date the check was returned. Next, at the top of the transaction, be sure to click the Is Reversal box.

When you’re ready, click the Save button to save the transaction. If the original contribution was itemized, the reverse will also be itemized, just as a negative amount.

# HOW DO I RECORD A DEPOSIT

How Do I Record a Deposit?
==========

Recording deposits is an important step in making sure incoming donations reflect just how they were deposited in your committee’s bank accounts outside of ISP. You can access the Record Deposit screen one of two ways, either the Record Deposit option in the Accounting tab or by clicking Undeposited Funds from the bottom of the Register screen.

When you arrive on the Deposit screen, you’ll see two sections: Deposit Summary and Deposit Transactions.

**Deposit Summary:** The Deposit Summary section contains details about the deposit you are creating. This includes Amount, which will adjust as you select or deselect transactions below, and Date of the deposit, which is the date the funds were deposited into your actual bank account.

The Deposit Number and Deposit Name fields are optional but in those fields you can add information that will allow you to track your deposits. These data points are searchable by other lists and reports throughout the system.

The Financial Account drop down will show all active Financial Accounts you have in the database.

**Deposit Transactions:** In the Deposit Transactions section you can select transactions to create a batch deposit. To select transactions, click the check box to the left of the transaction.

In the top left corner of the section, you’ll see a checkbox to the left of the Number column header. This allows you to select or deselect all of the transactions at once.

At the bottom of the screen is a dropup menu labeled Record. This contains various deposit recording options:

* **Record Deposit:** This will complete the process of creating the deposit.
* **Record Deposit & New:** This will create a deposit of the transactions you selected, then clear out the fields to create a new deposit.
* If you have the WinRed or ActBlue integration set up, you’ll also see a Record ActBlue Conduit Check or Record WinRed Conduit Check button. If you received a check from ActBlue or WinRed that comprises donations that came in through this conduit, you can create a specific deposit for those transactions to ensure reporting accuracy.

The Related Pages menu allows you to navigate to various helpful page: Balances, Non-Monetary Contributions, and the Register.

Use the print option to print the deposit screen to a PDF.

==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

# WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD TO REGISTER A FEC COMMITTEE

What Is the Threshold to Register a FEC Committee?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Committee registration must take place with the FEC the moment it reaches the $5000 threshold of money raised or spent. Per the FEC registration guidelines in the [FEC Campaign Guide](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/candgui.pdf):

* The individual and/or persons he or she has authorized to conduct campaign activity receive over $5,000 in contributions or make over $5,000 in expenditures; or
* The individual fails to disavow unauthorized campaign activity by writing a letter to the FEC within 30 days after being notified by the agency that another person or group has received contributions or made expenditures of more than $5,000 on the individual’s behalf. 100.3(a)(1)-(3) and 102.13(a)(2).

The necessary forms, [FEC Form 1](https://ispolitical.com/About-the-FEC-Form-1-Report/) and [FEC Form 2](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-the-form-2-and-when-do-i-file-it/), are found on the [FEC website](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/forms/).

After the committee has been registered with the FEC, reports must be filed no matter how much is raised or spent until the committee has been terminated.

# ABOUT THE MT COMMITTEE REPORT

About the MT Committee Report
==========

Applies To: Montana

The MT Committee Report Form is a Periodic Report for Contributions received and Expenditures made to Support or Oppose candidates or ballot issues. All counties, Municipal, and school district political committees will be required to file the C6 if either Contributions and Expenditures exceed $500 in value.

Log in to the state’s [Campaign Electronic Reporting System](https://cers-ext.mt.gov/CampaignTracker/dashboard) and find/create the report that covers your current reporting period. Once you’ve selected your report, go to View Finance Reports and the Upload button at the bottom. Each schedule must be uploaded separately.

Once you have completed an upload, there is no button to undo it. The most likely method of fixing an incorrect upload is manually editing out those transactions.

Accrued Expense Payments and Loan Received Repayments are *not* included in the upload file. These transactions must be manually entered and linked to their original transactions on the state system.

The MT Committee Report does not support the following:

* Accrued Expense Balance Reduction
* Loan Received Balance Reduction
* Loan-Made Balance Reduction

To designate an Expenditure as an Electioneering Communication, an Over Contribution Limit Refund, or an expenditure paid out of corporate funds, you must edit the desired transaction on CERS after uploading.

# HOW DO I EFILE WITH GEORGIA

How Do I Efile With Georgia?
==========

Applies To: Georgia

In order to E-file campaign finance reports with Georgia, there are a few one-time administrative steps that need to be taken. Let us help you file Georgia campaign finance reports within ISP.

To get started, all filers with a FilerID beginning with C, NC, or F must use the [EFiling system](http://EFiling systemhttps://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/index) to file any required reports. If you have not previously registered your account in the EFiling system, you will be required to do so by accessing the Register button.

All other filers (Lobbyists, Vendor Gifts Disclosures, Qualifying Officers) will use the Legacy EFiling system.

The state has a [Campaign Finance Commission University](https://ethics.ga.gov/cfcuniversity/), which has more information on how to register and use a new EFiling account, if needed. In addition to the University, the Campaign Finance Commission also provides [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9gQuI600Drda7thbBCnnw) on their YouTube channel.

Once your filer is set up with the state, here are some tips:

* After you login, go to Import Manager to import your file. Click Import File in the upper right, browse for your file, and name it as you choose.
* The import can take a while to process, especially on a heavy filing day. We recommend allowing for a few hours, even more if you have a large file (more than 8000 transactions). We have found it goes much smoother if you do not log out while the import is processing.
* While the import is processing, you can scroll to the right on the import manager, click the hot dog menu, and review your data. You can accept or reject the import.

Please note GA requires us to import all transactions and the itemization calculation is done on the software side.

# ABOUT AGGREGATES

About Aggregates
==========

An aggregate is the total of specific transactions for a specific time period. Examples include all contributions in a quarter or all expenses in an election cycle.

Aggregates for a new period restart the day after the election.

For this example, we’ll assume the itemization threshold is $100. On April 1st, May 1st, June 1st, and July 1st, you had $40 Expenses to Wal-Mart. The April and May Expenses would not itemize because expenses to Wal-Mart haven’t exceeded $100 yet. Only the June and July Expenses would itemize.

# HOW SHOULD DEBT THAT IS FORGIVEN APPEAR ON THE FEC FORM 3 3X 3P

How Should Debt that is Forgiven Appear on the FEC Form 3/3X/3P?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When it comes to debt forgiveness on FEC reports, specifically the Forms 3, 3X, and 3P, the corresponding entries will be reflected the same. This information has been[ confirmed by the FEC](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/handling-loans-debts-and-advances/personal-loans-candidate/).

When a balance reduction entry is entered into ISP with either the tag of Forgiven or Third Party Repayment, the system will automatically include the following entries on the FEC report. This will only apply to accrued expenses that meet the debt itemization thresholds explained[ here](https://ispolitical.com/why-are-my-accrued-expenses-not-itemizing-on-schedule-d/).

1. The balance reduction entry will appear on Schedule A receipts as a memo with memo text explaining that the debt was paid off either by forgiveness or a third-party repayment.
2. The original debt amount will appear on Schedule D in either the “Amount Incurred This Period” field (if the debt has not been previously disclosed), or the “Outstanding Balance Beginning This Period” field.
3. An additional text page will appear directly after Schedule D explaining that the debt was reduced by either forgiveness or a third-party repayment.

# ABOUT FEC BACKDOOR PASSWORDS

About FEC Backdoor Passwords
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC uses a Backdoor Password whenever there are significant differences between the original report and the amendment.

They define significant differences as any of the following:

* The dates of the report have changed.
* The report changes by approximately 50%, either with more or fewer transactions.
* A different original form was filed (typically Form 3 vs. Form 3X)

For example, a report with no transactions on it is filed in order to be filed on time, then amended later to include all appropriate transactions. Or, a report is filed with transactions from state and federal accounts or two different filers and half (or more) of the transactions need to be removed.

The exact percentage of change can be subjective to the analyst, so if you are making a large enough change in the amended report, it’s best to contact your analyst to confirm if a backdoor password is needed.

It is important to note the following:

1. Our system will always ask for a backdoor password. However, that does not mean a backdoor password is always required.

2. Only an analyst can create a backdoor password.

3. The password is good ONLY for 24 hours. The analyst can create another password if it expires, but it’s best practice to have the report approved & ready to file before obtaining the password.

How do I use a Backdoor Password?
----------

1. Generate the report with the Amended box checked. As with any other amended report, you will need to enter the previously filed Report ID (ex: FEC-123456) and the number of amendments. It’s also recommended to add a note why the report is being amended.

2. After the report is generated, click Efile Report. If you have your password saved, click the unlock symbol to reveal the fields. If not, the fields will already be displayed. Enter (or confirm) the regular filing password is correct, and enter the backdoor password as generated by the analyst.

If you don’t know have an FEC filing password, you can get one here:

[https://webforms.fec.gov/psa/index.htm](https://webforms.fec.gov/psa/index.htm)

If you had an FEC password, but have forgotten it, you can request that here:

[https://fecnotify.fec.gov/fecnotify/forgot-password/](https://fecnotify.fec.gov/fecnotify/forgot-password/)[](https://fecnotify.fec.gov/fecnotify/forgot-password/)

# WHAT ARE ISP BEST PRACTICES

What Are ISP Best Practices?
==========

Utilizing all ISP has to offer will make your job smoother and less time consuming. Below are some suggested best practices to help with that.

**Unlimited Users: Take Advantage of It:** ISP provides unlimited user access. It’s a good practice to take advantage of this feature and provide access to all team members who require it. This ensures everyone has access to the same information and reduces the risk of errors. It also allows you to give different users different levels of access and, if something goes wrong, know exactly who is responsible.

**Use 2FA:** Using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounting software. It ensures that only authorized users have access to the accounting records.

**Enter Data As It Happened:** Our core rule when it comes to how to create transactions in ISP is to enter the information as it happened in real time, such as using the real time date of a transaction or deposit. This will help ensure both your data and Compliance reports are accurate.

**Use Budget Categories for Both Receipts and Disbursements:** Using budget categories for receipts and disbursements helps with tracking the expenses and revenue of your campaign, party, or PAC. This, in turn, helps in creating a budget plan and analyzing the performance of the organization.

**Make Deposit Batches Frequently:** It’s a good practice to make deposit batches frequently rather than delaying it for an extended period. This ensures the accounting records are up to date and any discrepancies or errors can be identified early on.

**Perform Bank Reconciliations:** Bank reconciliations are a crucial part of accounting properly. Doing so ensures your records in ISP match with the transactions reported by the bank. This process allows you to be sure the records are accurate and complete. Failing to do so means that you could be filing incorrect campaign finance statements.

**Use One of Our Partners That Specializes in Politics for Accepting Donations:** Using a partner that specializes in politics for accepting donations ensures the donations are compliant with the relevant laws and regulations. This reduces the risk of any legal issues.

**Use AI to Import from Partners:** Using AI to import transactions from partners reduces the manual effort required to enter the data. This assures you the records are accurate and complete.

**Use AI to Check for Over the Limit Transactions and Other Issues:** Using AI to check for over the limit transactions and other issues helps in identifying any discrepancies or errors early on. This makes sure the necessary changes can be made before any legal issues arise.

**Use AI to Get Missing Occupations and Employers:** Using AI to get missing occupations and employers saves time and reduces the manual effort required to enter the data. It helps in keeping the accounting records accurate and up to date.

**Use AI to Combine Duplicate Entities:** Using AI to combine duplicate entities saves time and reduces the risk of errors. It helps in keeping the accounting records accurate and up to date and ensure that you don’t accidentally accept donations in excess of limits.

**Send Scheduled Reports to Candidate, Chair, and Other Key Personnel Who May Not be Daily ISP Users:** Sending scheduled reports to key personnel who may not be daily ISP users ensures that everyone is aware of the financial status of the organization. This helps in making informed decisions and planning for the future.

**Generate Your Compliance Reports Early:** Generating compliance reports early helps in identifying any issues or discrepancies early on. This allows you to make the necessary changes before the report is submitted.

**Use Dropbox Integration to Keep Legally Required Backup Right with the Associated Transaction:** Using Dropbox integration to keep legally required backups ensures the records are stored securely and can be accessed easily when required. This helps in complying with the relevant laws and regulations.

**Ask Support for Help:** Asking for support when required assures you that any issues or queries are resolved quickly. This helps in reducing the risk of errors and ensures the software is used efficiently.

# ISP GROWS AS COMPETITORS IN POSSIBLE COLLAPSE

ISP Grows as Competitors in Possible Collapse
==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

If you haven’t read [this Politico piece](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/05/democrats-ngp-van-collapse-00120184) about the “possible collapse”, don’t miss it. Brittany Gibson and Mandy Fernandez summarize the APAX acquisition, [recent layoffs](https://campaignsandelections.com/industry-news/staff-shake-ups-at-two-big-democratic-tech-companies/), technical issues, troubles of the company while citing unhappy former employees and important clients. It’s a terrifying picture for those who rely on last generation’s political tech behemoth.

Gibson and Fernandez recount the growing sentiment that “the Democratic Party has grown too dependent on a small handful of companies to carry the bulk of its campaign operations.”

Even before the UK based private equity firm, [Apax acquired NGP](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/apax-to-combine-three-social-impact-software-companies-in-deal-valued-at-2b/), problems arose. In the Politico article, Kenneth Pennington, partner at Democratic firm Middle Seat is quoted as saying, “There’s a pattern in Democratic software of creating a tool and then you stop updating it, you stop working on it, you stop developing and creating new releases for it.” My 20 years of experience in the political tech space screams “truth” in response to Pennington’s quote.

But what’s happening with existing firms isn’t just the normal death of a piece of political campaign technology. NGP VAN’s destiny was mapped out in [their press release](https://www.everyaction.com/blog/doing-more-good-social-solutions-cybergrants-apax/): “By bringing these three companies together, we are well positioned to match non-profits looking for more donations and volunteers, with the philanthropists, foundations, companies, and employees working with CyberGrants, who are looking for more opportunities to donate and volunteer.”

**You can do so much better. Come get the love you deserve from us at ISP.**

We’re hearing about other ‘last generation’ political tech companies imploding. Professionals and consultants call us every day with horror stories from their interactions with the reliable vendors of the 2000s and early 2010s.

**And in this mess, ISPolitical grows.**

Competitor political tech companies may be laying off hundreds, but we’re hiring. While their clients scour the web for new alternatives, we get flooded with calls from unhappy professionals irate about the lack of progress in their campaign technology, shoddy support, bad terms and service.

Why?

Fundamentally, we view our best customers as partners. Being the hungry new kid on the block means we have to be that much better, that much faster, that much more resourceful and flexible. We have to adapt and provide a superior service at similar rates.

We out compete by listening to our clients. No group of clients will ever send ISP an open letter, begging us to do our basic job. ISP client Jonathan Brill (FL) said, “We grow together and you guys are a true partner, not just another software vendor."

Combining vast years of expertise and experience in this industry with an agile development approach and a radical commitment to listening to clients creates a company whose bedrock is excellence in service.

# HOW DO I E FILE IN CONNECTICUT

How Do I E-file in Connecticut?
==========

Applies To: Connecticut

Connecticut’s E-File system requires you to generate your report in ISP, download it, then upload the content via their system. The process has multiple steps but isn’t difficult.

1. After generating the report in ISP, click the Download button to have the report downloaded to your computer in the format needed.
2. The downloaded efile is format .xls. If you open the file with Excel, you will get a warning message at the top of the file. This is ok. Connecticut has VERY specific Column Headers so the file is altered in a way to preserve this requirement. Excel’s safety feature can be overly cautious, but the file is perfectly ok and setup according to Connecticut requirements.
3. You can review your file with this warning as usual in Excel. However, if you want to manually modify any of your data outside of ISP (we do NOT recommend this unless instructed to do so), click on any empty cell, then click on the Formula Bar.

You may get a warning in a Microsoft Excel window that says the following:

“Protected View is preventing you from editing. If you trust the source of this file, click Enable Editing”

Click Enable Editing and you’ll be able to edit your data.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT update any of the column headers. There are a few column Headers that have a leading spaces, as per the state’s format, and removing those spaces will not allow your file to be uploaded.*

How do I efile my CT report?
----------

1. Go to eCRIS homepage: [https://seec.ct.gov/eCrisHome/](https://seec.ct.gov/eCrisHome/)[](https://seec.ct.gov/eCrisHome/)
2. Click eCRIS Login.
3. Enter state-issued login & password.
4. Under My Committees expand your Committee and click Financial Reporting.
5. Click Create A New Draft Report. Select appropriate year, Standard/Non-Standard Report, and Period Dates (if not automatically filed in for you).
6. Click Create Report.
7. Under Draft Reports, select OPEN.
8. At the bottom of the next page, click Upload Excel Report.
9. Click Browse and find the .xls report downloaded from ISP.
10. Select Upload.

After a few minutes, the state will either provide a new excel with errors to be corrected before filing, or a message that no errors were found. You cannot file a report until no errors are found.

We recommend you correct the errors in the database and regenerate the report rather than updating the .xls file downloaded from the system. This will help ensure data integrity between systems.

Once you have a report with no errors, check the box next to the report and click Review Warnings & File to State \>.

After you review the warnings, click Review Totals Page \> at the bottom of the page to review the Schedule Totals.

When ready, click File to State \> at the bottom of the page. You can also select View Draft Report to review all transactions. Click on the checkbox next to your name to certify the report, then select FIle to State.

# HOW DO I GET DATA IN MY NEW DATABASE

How Do I Get Data in My New Database?
==========

When you open an account with ISP, the database is an empty slate with no data. However, in order to effectively use the system as it was designed, filling it with data is an important first step.

We perform all initial data imports for free, either five files in a standard format such as Excel, or a full export from another financial compliance product. Please note that some free and low-dollar accounts do not include free imports. If you have any questions, please contact your sales representative.

After you send the data you’d like imported, you can expect a turnaround time of one business week. However, in rare cases, it can take longer.

To get started, send the files to support@ispolitical.com.

If you need more import options, check out the [Quick Import tool](https://ispolitical.com/quick-import-tool/) under the Tools tab.

If you need to do a regular import that doesn’t appear to be available, such as from your online donation processor, talk to us about integrations and custom import formats.

# ABOUT THE WA FORM C4 NON CANDIDATE

About the WA Form C4 – Non-Candidate
==========

Applies To: Washington

The Washington Form C4 – Non-Candidate is to report contributions and expenditures by a committee. Aggregation is totaled per Calendar Year. The Current Election selection determines the election Year. If you select Non-Election, we use the year in the To Date. To amend this report, set your date range to be the same as the original WA-C4 report. A filing for the same reporting period will automatically be considered an amendment.

Version Differences:
----------

* **PDC:** Expenses are itemized if each transaction is $50.01 or more. Refunded Contributions are only listed on Schedule A; Schedule C is not used. The itemization threshold for Accrued Expenses is $750.01
* **Seattle:** Expenses are itemized if the entity’s aggregate expenses are $50.01 or more in the reporting period. Refunded Contributions are listed three times: once on Schedule A and twice on Schedule C. Itemization threshold for Accrued Expenses is $250.01.

To file, log in to your [state account](https://apollo.pdc.wa.gov/) and upload the generated report from ISP.

For Seattle filers, access your [agency account](https://web6.seattle.gov/ethics/seecFiler/login.aspx) and upload the generated report from ISP.

# HOW DO I ADD MULTIPLE FILERS OR CHANGE THE EXISTING FILER

How Do I Add Multiple Filers or Change the Existing Filer?
==========

There will be scenarios in which you will need to have one or more filers in your database, or you will need to replace the existing filer.

How do I add a new filer?
----------

1. Create a new Organization Record for the New Filer and ensure the name is different than the original so they don’t get accidentally combined
2. Create the necessary relationship links. If linking to the same candidate for a different office, a new Candidate Record will need to be created to link to the new filer. If the Candidate Information is the same, you can use the existing record for the candidate.
3. Navigate to Reports and select Compliance.
4. Click the Related Pages Button at the bottom and when the pop out box appears, select Manage Filers.
5. Click the +Add Filer Button.
6. In the Entity field, enter the new Committee you just created and click on Add Filer. (You will likely see a warning about using up all your allotted filers, which you can ignore)

You will now have 2 filers in the account.

1. Navigate to Lists and select Financial Accounts.
2. Click +Add Financial Account.
3. Enter the details of the new financial account that will belong to the new committee and in the Filer field, select the newly added filer.
4. Click the Save button.

This will create a new financial account and link it to the new filer.

How do I replace an existing filer?
----------

1. Create a new Organization Record that is going to be the new filer. You will want to create the relationship links and if linking to the same candidate record, edit the Candidate Info section as well to match the new details.
2. Navigate to the Reports tab, then select Compliance.
3. Click Related Pages, then Manage Filers
4. Click the +Add Filer button.
5. In the Entity field, enter the committee that is going to be the new main filer and click on Add Filer. (You will likely see a warning about using up all your allotted filers, which you can ignore.)

You will now have 2 filers in the account.

1. Navigate to Lists \> Financial Accounts.
2. Click +Add Financial Account.
3. Enter the details of the new financial account and in the Filer field, select the newly added filer.
4. Click the Save button.

This will create a new financial account and link it to the new filer. You may want to click the red X next to the old financial account to avoid accidental data entry on the old filer if it’s no longer being used. The filer will not be deleted, only made Inactive.

# ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECORDS

About Individual Records
==========

Entity records in ISP are designed to house numerous pieces of valuable information. Below is a breakdown of what you’ll find in an Individual record.

At the top of each record you’ll find basic information, such as the name and Occupation and Employer info. If there is any contribution information, you’ll see a wrench icon where you can choose to display Key Stats, such as Most Recent Contribution, Total Donations, and more. If contact information is available, such as Email or Phone, you’ll have options to call or email them directly, as well as view their address on a map.

If you are a Federal filer and have a foreign address, the FEC recommends you keep the State Abbreviation blank and put the City, County Code, and Postal Code in Address Line 2.

If you need to make any edits to the name and other basic individual information, click on the green triangle in the top right corner to display a window where edits can be made.

In nearly all of the sections on the page, you’ll have the option to add information. Again, this done by clicking the green triangle in the right corner of the section. Some of these sections are Transactions, Flags, Relationships, Notes, and more.

If the individual is a Candidate of a committee, use the Candidate Info section on the right to add Office Sought or Office Held information. This data can play an important role when it comes to Compliance reports, including any affiliations to their committee in the Relationships section.

In the bottom right corner of each Individual record is an Elected Officials section. Here will display information about the officials in that entity’s area. This will be based on the address in the record itself. If you see no information in the Elected Officials section, double check the address to ensure it is properly formatted.

At the bottom of the page, use the Advanced Tools drop-up menu to make the record Inactive or Delete the record. The Delete option will not be available when the record contains critical information, such as financial transactions, for example.

Finally, you can print the record details or export it to a Call Sheet using the Print/Export button at the bottom of the screen. In the Advanced Tools option, you have the ability to change a record from Individual to Organization, or vice versa. You can also see if any combining happened with this record and undo that if desired.

# REPORTING RULES FOR JOINT FEC CA FILINGS

Reporting Rules for Joint FEC/CA Filings
==========

Applies To: California

There are many rules and processes to remember when it comes to filing compliance reports. If you file both FEC and CA reports, things can become even trickier.

Below are some pathways to keep in mind when handling transactions that could impact both FEC and CA reports.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Memo has a non-federal jurisdiction (either in the Candidate or Committee Info section in the record)

c. and the Support/Oppose tag is Support or [blank]

* This will pull to Schedule D on the 460 as a Non-Monetary Contribution and the Support box will be checked. There will be no corresponding expense on Schedule E. In addition, the Description will say: Expense Made to Support/Oppose State/Local Candidate via Federal Funds.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Memo has a non-federal jurisdiction (either in the Candidate or Committee Info section in the record),

c. and the Support/Oppose tag is Independent Expenditure

* This will pull to Schedule D on the 460 as a Non-Monetary Contribution and the Support box will be checked. There will be no corresponding expense on Schedule E. In addition, the Description will say: Expense Made to Support/Oppose State/Local Candidate via Federal Funds.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Memo has a non-federal jurisdiction (either in the Candidate or Committee Info section in the record),

c. and the Support/Oppose tag is Oppose

* This will pull to Schedule D on the 460 as a Non-Monetary Contribution and the Support box will be checked. There will be no corresponding expense on Schedule E. In addition, the Description will say: Expense Made to Support/Oppose State/Local Candidate via Federal Funds.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose tag is Independent Expenditure

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Independent Expenditure and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the parent transaction type is Non-Monetary Expense,

c. and the Support/Oppose tag is Support or [blank]

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Non-Monetary and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding memo expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the transaction OR parent transaction type is Loan Made Balance Reduction

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Non-Monetary and the Support box will be checked.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose tag is Oppose

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Independent Expenditure and the Oppose box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Entity is the same as the Parent Entity

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Monetary and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Entity is the Candidate associated (via Relationships) with the Parent Entity

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Monetary and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. the financial account is Non-Federal,

b. and the Support/Oppose Entity is the Ballot Measure associated (via Relationships) with the Parent Entity

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Monetary and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

**IF**

a. none of these rules apply

* This will pull to the Schedule D on the 460 as Non-Monetary and the Support box will be checked. There will be a corresponding expense on Schedule E.

Note it is also possible to have Non-Monetary and Oppose marked on CA Reports.

There is also a tag called Non-IE to Oppose. This functions much like the Support or no tag option.

* If the new tag is on a Support/Oppose Memo and the parent is a Non-Monetary transaction, this will pull to Schedule D as Non-Monetary Contribution and Oppose.
* If the new tag is on a Support/Oppose Memo and the parent is a different entity than the Support/Oppose Memo, this will also pull to Schedule D as Non-Monetary Contribution and Oppose.
* If the new tag is on a Support/Oppose Memo and the parent is the same entity (or the related candidate), this will pull to Schedule D as Monetary Contribution and Oppose.

# WHAT ARE REVERSALS AND REFUNDS HOW DO I ADD THEM

What Are Reversals and Refunds & How Do I Add Them?
==========

Reversals and refunds can be similar in that they’re both negative cash and negative net worth transactions. The line between the two is subtle.

On internal financial reports, like a Profit & Loss statement, a Reversed Monetary Contribution will show as a negative on the profit side. In contrast, a Refunded Contribution will show up on the loss side.

Which one do I use?
----------

Reversals are when the Monetary Contribution deposit is not fully completed. An example is an NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) when a deposited check is returned for insufficient funds.

A Refunded Contribution is when there is separate action taken. For example, your campaign sends the money back to a donor because they have exceeded limits.

How is each reported?
----------

Most commonly, the transactions show the Reversed Monetary Contributions on the Monetary Contribution schedule as a negative and the Refunded Contributions with expenses. However, this will vary per agency, as some have specific schedules for either or both.

How do I add a Refund?
----------

When creating a refund, a separate transaction will be created

* **Original transaction:** This transaction most likely already exists in your database prior to the need for a refund.
* **Refunded transaction:** This will be the second transaction created as the refund.

If the original transaction exists in your database, take the following steps to create the refund. If you still need to create the original transaction, please do that before following these steps:

1. From either the entity’s record or the Register, click the hotdog menu to the far right of the transaction
2. Select Add Refund
3. Ensure the populated fields, except for the Date, match the original transaction details
4. If the date of the refund is different than the current date, change the Date to match when the refund occurred
5. Complete the remaining applicable fields and click Save

A typical example of when you would need to use the refund process: a contribution is deposited into your bank account; then, for various reasons, the donation must be returned to the donor. This is a refund of a Monetary Contribution.

How do I add a Reversal?
----------

Similar to the refund, the reversal will also create a second transaction:

* **Original transaction:** This transaction most likely already exists in your database prior to the need for a reversal.
* **Reversed transaction:** This will be the second transaction created as the reversal.

Again, if the original transaction already exists in your database, take the following steps to create the reversal. If the original transaction has not yet been created, please do so before taking the steps below.

1. Create a new transaction from the entity’s record, the Register, or the Add Transaction option under the Accounting tab
2. Match the details of the original transaction except for the Date
3. In the Date field, use the date of the reversal
4. Click the Is Reversal box towards the top
5. Complete the remaining applicable fields and click Save

An example of when you would use a reversal is if, after you deposit a check into your account, you receive a notification the check bounced. This becomes a reversal situation since the funds never truly hit your account.

Can I just delete the original transaction?
----------

Please don’t.

Keeping an accurate and complete record of everything that happened is critical for proper bookkeeping. Entering the original Monetary Contribution/Expense and then a Refunded/Reversed Contribution/Expense ensures that you can (a) properly reconcile your bank account, (b) meet legal compliance reporting needs, and (c) have a clear record for future reference.

# WHY ARE THERE ERRORS IN MY CA CONFIRMATION EMAIL THAT ARE NOT IN ISP

Why Are There Errors in My CA Confirmation Email That Are Not in ISP?
==========

Applies To: California

In confirmation emails received from the state after filing your CA 460, sometimes warnings will be included that were not listed in the ISP system. This is because in most cases, those warnings do not apply to your committee.

Know that when it comes to the CA filing system, it’s well over 20 years old. In dog years, that’s at least 140 years old. Due to this, the error checking system isn’t as savvy as it could be.

Not all compliance report errors and warnings are the same. In fact, some of them can be very difficult to discern. Below are some things to keep in mind or attempt if you receive an error or warning you are unsure about.

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not a candidate committee:**

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s last name is missing. Field: 49

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s first name is missing. Field: 50

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s address is missing. Field: 53

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s city is missing. Field: 55

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s state is missing. Field: 56

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s zip is missing. Field: 57

These warnings are asking for name & contact information of the candidate associated with the committee’s. However, if your committee does not have a candidate, this would not apply. The ISP system is able to recognize this and will not list the warnings.

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not primarily-formed to support/oppose a specific candidate or measure:**

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Support/Oppose is missing. Field: 70

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is a candidate-controlled committee:**

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Filer data missing from cover page.
Refer to the CAL format version 2.01 for details or call your vendor.

CUR,W,2,CVR,F460,1460270,6,,Required by: FIELD4 = CAO

This warning is looking for an individual name – the validator thinks the actual candidate is filing the report rather than the candidate committee.

For further clarification on the warnings found in the confirmation emails received, please contact the state filing agency.

# HOW DO I USE QUICK IMPORT

How Do I Use Quick Import?
==========

The Quick Import tool allows various contact and contribution information to be imported into ISP in bulk.

When you choose the specific format from the drop-down menu, you will notice the info on the right side of the page changes based on each format. At the bottom of the section is a .csv template to save time creating your own .csv file. Click the link to download the template. You can then copy and paste your data into that template for import. If you save the template somewhere on your computer, you won’t have to download it each time. Simply copy and paste data each time into the saved template.

It’s important to ensure the data matches the correct column format in the file so it maps the data correctly in your account. There are four formats we accept as import formats for Quick Imports:

* comma-separated values (CSV)
* tab-separated values (TSV)
* Microsoft Excel; 2003 format (XLS)
* Microsoft Excel; current format (XLSX)

If you are creating your own spreadsheet based on the format, it’s necessary the import file has the correct extension. Also, be sure all data is on a single page or tab in the spreadsheet.

Several specialized formats are also not enabled by default. Contact Support if you are looking to use a specific template that is not showing in the Format drop-down menu.

### Can I undo an import? ###

Making mistakes happens. If you need to undo an import, click the Undo Recent Import button at the bottom of the Quick Imports screen. In the window that appears, you’ll see all recent imports with an option to Delete.

# HOW DO I ADD A REATTRIBUTION OR REDESIGNATION

How Do I Add a Reattribution OR Redesignation?
==========

The difference between a Reattribution and Redesignation is an important one, both for compliance and financial reasons.

**Reattribution:** One donation is split between two or more people. The most common example of this is a donation was made from a joint checking account and a portion of the donation needs to be reattributed to a spouse.

**Redesignation:** All or a portion of a donation is moved to a different election. The most common example of this is a donation received for the primary election that is greater than the per election limit and part of it is being redesignated to the general election. With a Redesignation, check with your filing agency for any specific rules regarding the redesignation process.

### How do I add the Redesignation or Reattribution? ###

First, locate the original transaction either in the Register or within the entity’s record. From there, click on the hot dog menu (the three dots to the right of the transaction) and select Redesignation/Reattribution.

This will direct you to a screen showing entity details on the right and transaction details on the left. At the top of the transaction details is a toggle switch labeled Transaction Tag. This allows you to determine if the transaction you are about to create is a Reattribution or a Redesignation.

Once you’ve completed the fields, click Save or Save & New. A memo transaction will then be created based on the Reattribution or Redesignation you created.

If you’d like to view the transactions related to the Reattribution or Redesignation, or any transaction that has Splits or related transactions, click the hot dog menu, then select See Related Transactions. From there you’ll be able to edit any related transactions, if needed, or just confirm the details.

# HOW DO I EXPORT DATA OUT OF WINRED FOR QUICK IMPORTS IN ISP

How Do I Export Data Out of WinRed for Quick Imports in ISP?
==========

If you choose to import WinRed data manually via Quick Imports in ISP, it’s important to be sure you are capturing and exporting the right data in your WinRed account.

In WinRed, there are three different data imports you can select from.

**Export of Donations:** This export does NOT contain conduit/batch information so while this may provide donation data, it’s not the best export option for importing into ISP.

**Export of Payouts:** This can provide good info but it will be multiple files, as you will have to download each Payout one at a time. Again, we don’t recommend this one.

**Export of Transactions:** This is a more robust export, as it provides data on contributions, refunds, and expenses. We recommend using this option to pull data from your WinRed account.

Once you navigate to your desired export option, click the filter icon and filter the data you want to include in your export. Ideally, it would be wise to capture all data. However, if you choose to not include report disputes or other items, you can do so.

After you’ve created the desired filter, click Apply Filter and the page will refresh. Next, click Download. In order to actually retrieve the file, in your WinRed account navigate to Utilities, then to Data Export. In the list of generated reports, you should see the one you just created at the top. Click the green Download Ready button to export the data for import into ISP.

# HOW DO I ADD AND REPORT NEGATIVES IN DEPOSIT BATCHES

How Do I Add and Report Negatives in Deposit Batches?
==========

Applies To: Washington

When it comes to negative refunds and WA reporting, they will only show on the C4 report, not the C3.

To create the refund, navigate to the transaction in question either in the record or the Register, then select Add Refund from the hot dog menu to the right of the transaction.

After you’ve added the refund to the system, in the Register locate the deposit you need to add the refund to and click it to open up the details. On the resulting page, click the Add Deducted Fees button at the bottom of the screen.

In the options, select Existing Refund. A window will pop up and from there you will select the refund transaction you just created to add to the deposit. Only refunds within 7 days prior of the deposit date will show.

When you generate the C4 report, your refund will show on Schedule A in the Expenditures section.

# WHAT ARE THE NEW SEARCH GROUP AND ADD COMPOUND RULE BUTTONS IN ADVANCED SEARCH

What Are the New Search Group and Add Compound Rule Buttons in Advanced Search?
==========

Advanced Search is a record-based search that allows you to create and run searches with detailed results. When adding various layers of rules or criteria, you have two buttons, New Search Group and Add Compound Rule, that will allow you to get even more detailed with your search and results.

### New Search Group ###

The New Search Group button allows you to create an OR scenario in your search. When you utilize this button, you can have the results match either rule that is in place instead of both at the same time. To use the New Search Group button add a new rule in the Rule area to your existing rule and click the Add New Search Group button.

### Add Compound Rule ###

The Compound Rule button allows you to combine search criteria to narrow down your results even further. This creates an AND scenario for the results. In order for the Compound Rule button to appear, the Area of each rule will need to be the same.

# ABOUT THE INDIANA CFA 4

About the Indiana CFA-4
==========

Applies To: Indiana

The IN CFA-4 is used to report Receipts and Expenditures of a Political Committee. Which schedule the report transactions pull to will depend on several factors, including transaction type and entity type.

* **Schedule A:** This schedule contains itemized contributions and receipts
* **Schedule B:** This schedule shows itemized expenditures
* **Schedule D:** This schedule reflects debts owed BY the committee
* **Schedule E:** This schedule is for debts owed TO the committee

Other schedules you may see are the A2 and the A5.

* **A2:** This schedule shows contributions by corporations
* **A5:** This schedule contains contributions by other organizations, including LLCs/LLPs

To ensure the LLC/LLP pulls to Schedule A5, ensure the following:

* In the main record details at the top of the record, it’s showing as Business
In the Business Info section, the Type is LLC or LLP

The File Number is the Filer Committee ID. If you plan to e-file, then you will need to get a Committee ID. Otherwise, leave this field blank.

To file your report, you must first download the generated file. Then, log into the [Indiana Campaign Finance Website](https://campaignfinance.in.gov/CampaignFinance/UserLogin.aspx) and upload your file through the import process. You can undo a submitted file as long it has not been included in a filed report.

If you encounter any errors that need to be fixed on a filed report, please ensure that the data is updated on ISP and the state system. This will help prevent future discrepancies.

At this time, Indiana’s campaign finance online system does not allow the importing of amended reports.

# WHAT ARE EXPENSE TRANSACTION TAGS AND HOW DO I USE THEM

What Are Expense Transaction Tags and How Do I Use Them?
==========

Transaction Tags are an important way of ensuring Expense transactions are reported correctly. Because these are related to Compliance law, the Tags in your account will vary based on the jurisdiction you file with.

### How are Expenses and Transaction Tags related? ###

Typically, the standard data entry model in ISP is the Expense is to the Entity that was paid and the Support/Oppose Memo is associated with the Candidate (or Measure) supported. In essence, this is entering what is actually going on, and we’ve built the system logic to automatically take the data entry and report it appropriately.

If you are filing with the FEC, this matches how their forms work. They have two sections for each transaction: (1) who was paid, and (2) the supported FEDERAL Candidate.

However, for Non-Federal Candidates, you do not include the Candidate information; it just shows who the Expense is to. In this [example from the FEC guide](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-ssf-reports/donations-nonfederal-candidates/), you’ll see that the Candidate Name and Office Sought fields are blank.

### What are the available Expense Transaction Tags? ###

In the Specify Support/Oppose section of an Expense, there are four transaction tags listed

* **IE to Oppose:** Use this tag for Independent Expenditures opposing an issue or candidate.
* **IE to Support:** Use this tag for Independent Expenditures in support of other candidates or issues.
* **Non-IE to Oppose:** This tag is most commonly used for member communications.
* **Non-IE to Support**: Use this tag on either a Direct Contribution or an Expense Support/Oppose, commonly known as an In-Kind Contribution.

These four tags will cover almost all of the situations in which Support/Oppose Memos are needed for reporting.

# WHAT ARE CA LLC LLP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

What Are CA LLC/LLP Reporting Requirements?
==========

Applies To: California

LLCs/LLPs in California have certain rules to follow, including a requirement for the Legal Responsible Officer to be reported, as well.

1. Create the contribution from the LLC. Make sure the entity record’s business type is LLC or LLP.
2. Add a relationship to the person considered the Legal Responsible Officer. It’s best to use the relationship type Employee/Employee of for this. Make sure the relationship is the Primary relationship.

ISP will automatically pull this LLC/LLP contribution to your report as required. This means the Legal Responsible Officer will pull to the donor block for the LLC/LLP contribution on the PDF. On the e-File version of the report, it’ll pull as a text block containing the information indicating the LLC/LLP and Legal Responsible Officer link.

# WHY ARE MY BROADCAST EMAILS TAKING SO LONG TO BE DELIVERED

Why Are My Broadcast Emails Taking So Long to Be Delivered?
==========

The deliverability numbers of broadcast emails can be categorized into two areas: warming up the email and scrubbing the list.

Warming Up the Email
----------

In basic terms, warming up the email means sending emails in small batches to build up a reputation and to avoid triggering spam filters. If the emails are sent out in a large blast at once with an email that is unknown it is a huge flag and will result in a lot of bounces

The email used for sending your list takes time to warm up. Having the SPF entry will help increase deliverability, but there is still a warm up period with the new email used for broadcasting. The other part of the warm up process is the broadcast servers. Those are already well warmed up, so your focus only needs to be on the email address.

Broadcast emails allow the list to not be opt in only. Warming up an email can be important as you are more likely to be starting at neutral and not have a reputation with other email servers. Warming up an email typically takes about 30 days but can take longer if engagement is low.

Broadcast Email servers recommend people on the campaign are included in the broadcast. This helps ensure it marks any emails received via the broadcast as not spam. Replying to them also increases your email reputation.

You can also try sending to smaller groups and building up the list size. We recommend sending regularly, once a week to every few days at most. This is the easiest way to build up the email reputation and deliverability over time. However, be careful with increasing broadcast and causing more people to unsubscribe or mark you as spam.

Scrubbing the List
----------

New emails on a list in a broadcast go through a scrubbing server before being sent. This is to make sure poison pill emails and other landmines are blocked and not included in the broadcast, which could ruin the ability to send broadcast emails completely.

Initially, with a newly uploaded list, the emails are checked to see if they are valid. This process looks for responses from other email servers to indicate they exist. The warmed up broadcast email servers play into being trusted here, but not all emails or services give a response or provide a response right away.

Sometimes they are intentionally delayed or a communication error/block on the internet gets in the way. Those may result in temporary bounces initially, but those slowly go away as more broadcasts are sent and more responses are collected. When you see a high bounce rate, it likely has to do with a low or slow response from email servers. The recommended waiting period is 24 hours before resending to those that did not respond with a read receipt.

# HOW DO I ADD A FULL OR PARTIAL PAYMENT TO AN ACCRUED EXPENSE

How Do I Add a Full OR Partial Payment to an Accrued Expense?
==========

When you have an Accrued Expense with a remaining balance, you can add payments, full or partial, to pay off that debt.

1. Navigate either to the transaction in the entity’s record OR to the Balances page under the Accounting tab.
2. On the far right of the transaction, click the three stacked dots (hot dog menu).
3. In the options that appear, select the Add Payment option. Complete the necessary fields and click Save.

If you have an Accrued Expense and the payment involves different payment methods (Cash, Check, Credit Card, etc.), you can create partial payments to pay off the expense. This happens in multiple transactions. Using the steps above, create the payment using the method and amount for one of the payments towards the Accrued Expense. Next, using the same steps, create another payment, this time with a different payment method and/or amount.

If you used a credit card, you’ll need to also account for this new debt to the credit card company. In this case, when creating the credit card Accrued Expense payment, click the Is Memo box. This will still lower or pay off the amount owed to the Accrued Expense. Note, though, that when it comes to the Cash On Hand situation, it will still reflect you now owe on the credit card, which is paid off using standard Expense with Splits transactions.

The hot dog menu has various options of reducing the Accrued Expense, such as Add Balance Reduction and Add Void. Other options are viewing either the change history or related transactions, as well as navigating to the entity’s record. The Add Payment-Multiple Outstanding allows you to choose more than one expense to pay if the repayment is coming from the same source.

**What if the payment is being made by a third party?**

When adding a balance reduction transaction, select the entity making the payment. The method, inkinds included, is not important for compliance but you can add detail to the Compliance Note field, if you choose.

**Can I add Splits to my Accrued Expense Payments?**

We support Splits on Accrued Expense payments under specific conditions. This is only available on the FEC Form 3 and the FEC Form 3x Non-Party.

1. You must have the tool Support Accrued Expense Payment Splits. This is a tool that can only be added by ISP staff, so reach out to Support if you’d like to add this tool.
2. Add the splits to the Accrued Expense Payment rather than the original Accrued Expense. The splits will pull to the report when the payment does.

# BEST PRACTICES FOR CA WARNINGS ERRORS

Best Practices for CA Warnings & Errors
==========

Applies To: California

Not all compliance report errors and warnings are the same. In fact, some of them can be very difficult to discern. Below are some things to keep in mind or attempt if you receive an error or warning you are unsure about.

First, when it comes to the CA filing system, it’s well over 20 years old. In dog years, that’s at least 140 years old. Due to this, there may be days where you experience trouble filing the report.

Perhaps the most common issue CA filers encounter is the system getting overloaded. Typically this happens on heavy filing days. Your best bet is to wait an hour or so, then try filing the report again.

Unfortunately, when their system is bogged down, there isn’t anything we can do to push the report through. However, send us an email anyway, as this creates a paper trail and we can use that if we need to follow up with the Secretary of State. If you do reach out to us, please also be sure to include a screenshot of the error you are receiving, as well as the report criteria.

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not a candidate committee:**

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Candidate/Officeholder’s last name is missing. Field: 49

This is a warning for line: 2

Candidate/Officeholder’s state is missing. Field: 56

This is a warning for line: 2

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not formed to support/oppose a specific candidate or measure:**

This is a warning for line: 2
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR
Support/Oppose is missing. Field: 70

# WHAT ARE INTERNAL TRANSFERS

What Are Internal Transfers?
==========

Internal Transfers allow you to move funds between accounts and they are created similar to other transaction types, either with the Add Transaction option under the Accounting tab or in the Transactions section of a record. In both locations, select Internal Transfer from the Type drop down menu.

The To and From Account options allow you to choose which accounts will be involved in the funds transfer.

Please note that Internal Transfers are for non-reportable transfers, or in other words, transfers between accounts under the same filer. If you are attempting to transfer funds between accounts that involve different filers, even though they may be associated with the same committee, these are considered reportable and added to the system in a different way.

Once you’ve added all the needed details for the Internal Transfer, click the Save or Save & Close button at the bottom of the screen. You also have a Save & New button if you need to create more transactions.

# HOW DO I POPULATE THE COVER PAGE ON MY TX REPORT

# WHAT ARE CHECK REQUESTS

What Are Check Requests?
==========

Handling multiple check requests for various expenses can be difficult to manage. Fortunately, all the requests you receive can now be received and processed in one place in ISP.

To install this tool, first select Add/Remove Tools under the Tools tab. Next, on the Tools page, type Check in the search bar. Then, click the Check Requests section header that appears under the word Available.

If the feature has not been enabled yet, you’ll first see a message welcoming you to the feature and also providing an email address you can share with others. This will allow them to send the check request directly to the system instead of your email inbox.

The format of the email address will be [account name]@checkrequest.ISPolitical.com.

Once you’ve copied down the email address, click the Enable button at the bottom of the screen. Doing so will allow requests to be received and processed.

When you receive a request for a check, you’ll see the request on the Check Requests screen, which will include the date of the request, who the request is from, and the text of their email.

At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see three options:

**Reject:** This option allows you to reject the request, as well as provide a reason for the rejection. Also, the individual who requested the check will receive an email notification that the check request was rejected and also see the reason why.

**Skip For Now:** This option allows you to skip the request and move on to the next request if more time is needed to consider the request.

**Create Expense:** This option will direct you immediately to the Add Transaction screen, where you can add the expense details, after which you’ll be able to print the check and move forward. Furthermore, the individual who requested the check will also receive an email stating the request was accepted and a check is being processed.

# FORM 3 ERRORS AND WARNINGS

Form 3 Errors and Warnings
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees

Sometimes you’ll encounter warnings or errors after generating a FEC Form 3 report that can easily be resolved. Below are a few common errors and how to get rid of them. For most of these you can use the hot dog menu to the right of the error to navigate to the specific location where the fix needs to happen.

Committee or Candidate Related Issues
----------

First, review your [filer’s record settings](https://ispolitical.com/What-Records-are-Needed-for-Compliance-Reporting/). Ensuring your filer is set up correctly will save you a lot of headaches down the road.

**Required Committee ID Number or Invalid FEC Committee ID Number**
You can update this in the Committee Info section. Click the edit icon in the top right and add or edit the info in the ID Number field.

**Required Treasurer**
Make sure the treasurer has been added to the database as an Individual. If not, add the treasurer. Then navigate to the Committee record and go to the Relationships section. Click the edit icon in the top right of the section and in the window that appears, search for the Treasurer’s individual record in Affiliated and choose Treasurer from the Relationship Type menu.

**Invalid FEC Candidate Office Sought ID Number**
Navigate to the Candidate’s record and in the Candidate Info section, click the edit icon in the top right corner. In the window that appears, add or edit the Office Sought ID Number. Make sure you use the [Candidate ID](https://ispolitical.com/What-is-the-Difference-Between-FEC-Candidate-IDs-and-Committee-IDs/) rather than the Committee ID.

Donor Related Issues
----------

**Required Address**
In the donor’s Individual record, locate the Address section and click the Add icon in the right corner. Add the address and be sure to mark it as Primary Reportable.

**Required Occupation and Required Employer**
In the donor’s Individual record, specifically at the top of the record, will be where Occupation and Employer information, among other data, is found. In order to edit this information, click the edit icon in the top right and in the window that appears, add Occupation and Employer information.

Transaction Related Issues
----------

**Required Note for Compliance**
When you see this error, a specific transaction requires a note that will be included on the report explaining the purpose of the transaction. You can handle this by navigating to the transaction either from the Register or within the entity’s record, then click the transaction in question to view the details of the transaction. Locate the Compliance Note field and add the purpose of the transaction.

Report Generation Related Issues
----------

**This filing is older than the last amendment**
If you see this error, please double check the FEC ID you are using of the [report you are amending](https://ispolitical.com/Best-Practices-for-Filing-FEC-Amendments/). This can be found on your committee’s page on the FEC site. Also double check the Number of Amendments.

**There is a calculation discrepancy with the current Election Cycle to Date total for Line X.**
Current Election Cycle to Date total should be equal to Period Total plus previously filed Election Cycle to Date

If you are receiving this error, most likely a transaction on a previously filed report has changed – for example, new transactions were added, an older transaction was removed, a financial account was updated, a committee type was updated, a relationship to the filer added or removed, or a transaction tag was added or removed. Any one of those actions would change how a transaction was reported and therefore impact the summary line totals.

Use the Changed Transactions Report found on the [Compliance Tools](https://ispolitical.com/About-Compliance-Tools/) page under the Reports tab. In the Report menu select Changed Transactions, select the filer if there are multiple in your database, then add the Report Close Date and Report Generation Date. This will list potential transactions that may be causing the discrepancy.

You can also generate reports moving back one report at a time until the report generated matches the report filed. You’ll then know the next report is where the discrepancy started. From there, do a line by line comparison with the reports to determine what transaction either went missing from the line or was added to the line.

**Starting Cash On Hand not equal to Ending Cash on Hand on Previous Filed Report**
Typically this happens when transactions have been added or removed from a financial account or database after a report has been filed. Just as with a line calculation discrepancy, this can be determined by comparing reports that have been filed with the same report freshly generated out of the system. Once you locate when they match, the report after that will be where the discrepancy occurred.

**Calculation discrepancy with the current Election Cycle to Date total for Lines 11ai and 11aii but not 11aiii.**
If you are receiving this error for lines 11ai and 11ai but not 11aiii, the cause is likely the value you entered for Previous Unitemized Individual Donations when generating the report. Confirm that is correct or use the Get from FEC feature.

# HOW DO I CREATE THE EFUNDRAISING CONNECTIONS INTEGRATION

How Do I Create the eFundraising Connections Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

eFundraising Connections is a payment processing platform allowing you to collect donations and track donor contact data. There are no start up or monthly subscription fees to use the program, and it easily integrates with ISP. Before you set up the integration in ISP, be sure you have your eFundraising Connections account set up, as well.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from eFundraising Connections via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, eFundraising Connections will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

### How do I install the eFundraising Connections integration? ###

1. Under the Integrations tab, select Add/Remove Integrations
2. Scroll down to the Available section and locate eFundraising Connections
3. Click on it to add it to the Installed section

At this point, in another tab, log into your eFundraising account.

1. Navigate to the Integrations section
2. Check the box next to ISPolitical, and enter the Account Name. Make sure to use your short account name. This is the name that appears in the top left of your screen next to the text ISP:.

If you encounter any trouble with this portion of the set up, please contact the support team at eFundraising Connections.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create an eFundraising Connections organization record in the account with the eFundraising Connection’s details.

When data is passed to ISP, it will appear in the [Pending Imports section](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) of your Dashboard.

# WHAT ARE QUICK EMAILS

What Are Quick Emails?
==========

Quick Emails is a tool that allows you to send email only to the email address in one single individual record. The emails are based on templates you create, which make it very useful for multiple people to follow up after a call with a donation link or other fundraising activities.

In order to use the Quick Emails tool, make sure it is installed on your account. Navigate to the Tools menu and you should see an option for Quick Emails. If not, you will need to click on Add/Remove Tools and select it from the list of tools you can install.

How do I set up Quick Emails?
----------

On the Quick Emails page under the Tools tab, click Add Quick Email to first create an email template. The template you create will become a selectable option for your email communication. You can create as many as you need.

**Email Name:** This is the name for the email. It should be something easily identifiable in a list of template options, if you plan to use more than one.

**Record As:** This allows you to indicate a specific communication type. Communication types can be customized under Lists \> Communication Types and allow tracking of any type of communications with that particular individual or organization.

**Subject:** Subject line of the email.

**Text:** The body of the email template. Links and images can both be placed in the email template allowing for more visually appealing emails.

**Merge Fields:** In the body text of an email, you can insert merge fields. These fields can be used to pull data to the email based on the record information.

**Send As User/Reply to User:** When checked, the email sender and/or reply person will be indicated as the user currently creating the template regardless of who actually sends the email. If you want a different name to appear on emails, uncheck the box and enter the name you want.

Once you have created a template and saved it, you have the option to add an attachment to be sent with the Quick Email. You can do this by clicking on [Add Attachment] to the right of where your email template appears on the Quick Emails page.

How do I use Quick Emails?
----------

To send an email, navigate to any individual record, locate the Quick Communications button at the bottom, then click Quick Email. This will give you the option to select the email template you want and add a follow-up reminder at the same time. Your Quick Email is not sent until you click Update Send Quick Email at the bottom.

Note: Quick Emails will only be an option on individual records with emails already present. Make sure to add an email first to the record before trying to send.

# FINANCIAL REPORT RECIPE DONORS BY QUARTER USING CONDUIT DATE

Financial Report Recipe: Donors by Quarter Using Conduit Date
==========

There may be scenarios where you want to pull a financial report to search for contributions where the Whole Date is, for example, the span of a reporting period.

Following these steps will retrieve all contributions that were either directly given in one period or given through a conduit and the conduit’s check was received in the same period:

1. Navigate to Reports, then to Financial
2. On the Financial Reports page, select Transactions from the Report field dropdown menu
3. Click the downward-facing arrow next to the words Transaction Date, then choose Whole Date from the dropdown menu
4. Make a selection from the Whole Date field dropdown menu
5. In the Transaction Type box, select Monetary Contribution from the dropdown menu
6. Click the Generate button

Using Whole Date in the Transactions Report negates the need for individual donors to be listed on the Period Results Report.

If you want to list donors by Individuals or Organizations, select Entity Type from the dropdown menu in the Columns box.

To aggregate donors, select Aggregate by Entity from the Aggregate Option field dropdown menu.

# HOW DO I COPY DATA BETWEEN MY ACCOUNTS

How Do I Copy Data Between My Accounts?
==========

One of the unique features ISP offers is the ability to copy record information from one of your accounts to another using the Advanced Search page. You can copy the specific records returned in a search and include any records linked via Relationships (and those Relationship links as well), Flags on the records, and Third Party Donation information.

Once in the account you want to copy from, navigate to Add/Search and then select [Advanced Search](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-advanced-search-and-how-do-i-use-it/). Enter the criteria needed to return the records you want. Click Exports & Actions and then Copy to Another Account. Select the account you want to copy the data to. You will also see several checkbox options for additional details to include.

* Include Spouses: This will also include any records linked to records returned in the search results via a Spouse Relationship
* Include All Related Entities: This will include relationships from the returned entity and any additional records associated with those relationships
* Include Flags: If you have any flags on the records and want those copied over as well, check this
* Include Third Party Donations: If you are using the Third Party Donation feature in your current account to track donations made to other committees, you can also have that donation information copied over as well
* Copy Contributions As Third Party Donations: Any contributions copied to the new account will be copied as Third Party Donations and linked as supporting the specific filer (account you’re copying from)

Once you click Process the data will begin to be copied over to the account selected. This is usually completed in about 5-15 minutes and our system will send you an email to indicate it is done.

# ABOUT THE IL FORM D 2

About the IL Form D-2
==========

Applies To: Illinois

The IL Form D-2 Report is used to file Quarterly and Final reports, as well as Amendments to those filings. If you would like to itemize every transaction on your report, use the Itemize All version. Otherwise, use the Standard version.

Anonymous transactions are automatically unitemized. If you want Anonymous transactions to pull to the report, add the Other Income transactions to the Anonymous record on the Other Entities page.

Illinois e-filing expects the type of transaction, such as Monetary Contribution, to be submitted with an exact format, including spelling and capitalization. To accommodate the All Caps option, there are some words that will never be in all caps, like Contribution or Expenditure.

This report also supports Investments. Create a Financial Account with Investment as the type, and ensure that’s linked to the bank’s organization record. Also ensure that the Date Opened is filled in; that is used on the report. Once you’ve done that, create an Internal Transfer from the filer’s regular account to the investment account.

# HOW DO I FILE A CA FORM 496

How Do I File a CA Form 496?
==========

Applies To: California

The CA FPPC Form 496 compliance report is used to report Independent Expenditures that are $1,000 or more in aggregate to support (or oppose) a single candidate (or committee) 90 days before an election.

If you are expecting a transaction to pull to this report, make sure there is a Support/Oppose Memo on the transaction. More specifically, a S/O Memo with the IE to Support or IE to Oppose tag. If there are multiple reports, they will generate in alphabetical order based on the S/O Memo.

If a transaction pulls to this report that you are not expecting, then this could be due to the designated election. For example, if the Current Election is Non-Election, then the report uses the date it is generated (in lieu of an election date) and goes back 90 days from this report generation date.

Included on the FPPC Form 496 are contributions received that are $100 or more per transaction since the last filed statement (Form 460, for example).

How do I set up the Form 496 Report in ISPolitical?
----------

When generating a FPPC Form 496 in ISPolitical, navigate to the Reports tab, then Compliance. On the resulting criteria page, set up the following required fields:

**Filer**: Make sure the correct person/entity is selected (if you have more than one).
**Compliance Report:** Select the CA Form 496 from the listed report types.
**Compliance Report Version:** Select either the Standard version, or the Ten Business Day version. The Ten Business Day version is filed by state and local committees making Independent
Expenditures associated with a Ballot Measure whose combined total
is $5,000 or more any time outside of the 90 days before an election.
**Current Election**: The report will use the Current Election field to determine the 90-day report period for the Independent Expenditures.
**From/To Dates**: This sets the starting date and ending date for the Contributions. Make sure to enter the From Date as the day after the closing date of the last filed report.

For Example: Your last filed report is the April Quarterly. That report’s close date was 3/31. The date you would enter in the From Date field would be 4/1.

**Entity**: This is an optional field. If you know the name of the Support/Oppose entity, you can begin typing the name to search and choose, and generate the report for the specific entity. Leaving this field blank will randomly select the Support/Oppose Memo that applies.

How do I generate Form 496 reports for multiple candidates/committees?
----------

The Form 496 is unique in that a new report is needed for each candidate or committee with an Independent Expenditures over $1,000 in aggregate in the period or contributions over $100 since the last filed report.

It’s quite common for a committee to have an expense for one business that supports 4 different candidates.

In this type of situation, follow these steps to generate multiple Form 496 reports:

1. Run the report. ISPolitical will automatically select your first candidate/committee and generate a Form 496 report.
2. Review the data.
3. Make sure you file the report and then click Mark As Filed once you receive confirmation.
4. Click Regenerate. The candidate/committee automatically selected in step 1 will be skipped and the next one automatically selected.
5. Repeat until all candidates/committees have a corresponding Form 496 report.

# ABOUT THE FEC FORM 3 REPORT

About the FEC Form 3 Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 3 Report is a disclosure report of Receipts and Disbursements for authorized committees. To generate the report, go to the Reports tab, then to Compliance. On the resulting screen will be the criteria you’ll need to set to generate the report. Be sure to use the correct criteria to generate the necessary and compliant results. Some fields, including Previous General Election Date, can have a significant effect on totals.

* The 012 Splits Independent of Whole version itemizes splits with reporting code 012 on Line 21 regardless of the whole parent reporting code.
* The 012 Splits with Whole version itemizes splits on Line 21 if the whole transaction has reporting code 012.

Neither version is the right one, as this is a stylistic choice. The FEC has no preferred method.

The report parameter fields are as follows:

**Date Range:** Please ensure that your date range lines up with either standard FEC reporting dates or dates that are specific to your report. i.e. Pre-Primary, Post-General, etc.

**Current Election:** You will see a dropdown that contains all of the elections that are set up for your campaign.

**Previous General Election:** This field is extremely important to ensure you have the correct dates so to avoid errors.

**Amended:** If you are filing an amendment, if this is a new report this box should not be clicked. If you are filing an amendment you will click this box and additional fields will appear. You will need to select the report in which you are amending. All reports filed out of ISP will appear in the dropdown, if you filed your report outside of ISP you will select Filed Outside of ISP. You will then need your Original Report Number, this number will start with FEC-. The last additional field is the Number of Amendments. We recommend that amendment numbers go in order starting at 1.

**Report Period:** The available report periods will appear in the dropdown.

**Previously Unitemized Individual Donations:** This is another very important field that is required on your report. This number needs to be correct or it could cause calculation errors on your report. You have two options for filling in this field:

* You can locate the number on the previously filed report. If your previously filed report was a Post-General or Year End with Col C, use the amount found in Col C here instead. Previous unitemized individual donations are reported on Line 11aii, Column B of your previously filed report.

OR

* You can click Get From FEC.

Aggregates for a new election cycle will restart the day after the election. If you have a whole transaction before the election and a split below the itemization threshold after the election, that split will not itemize on the report.

**All Caps:** This will generate your entire report in all caps.

**Sort Order:** If you click the dropdown this will give a variety of ways in which you can have your report sorted.

**EXCLUDE Unitemized Transfer Total:** Checking this box removes the Total Unitemized transaction on Line 12. If this box is unchecked, the system will pull the total of untemized splits as a memo transaction, rather than the total of splits when the transaction is unitemized. Additionally, if the total of splits is less than the whole amount, the system pulls a memo transaction for the difference.

**Notes:** The notes block has a character max of 4000 characters. An example of when this could be used is if you need to inform the FEC of best efforts to obtain Occupation/Employer information or of a contribution over the limit that will be refunded on the next report.

We recommend upon completion of generating your report, that you save it as a PDF for your records or to compare to other reports. This must be done at the time of generation, or you will not be able to save it as a PDF without generating it. You can also download the e-filing for your records as well.

Additionally, if there is no Employer information for a particular Individual, then the words Information Requested will populate in the Name of Employer field. Likewise, if there is no Occupation information, then these words will populate in the Occupation field.

# MY PDC C3 AMENDMENT FILED AS A NEW REPORT HOW DO I FIX THAT

My PDC C3 Amendment Filed as a New Report – How Do I Fix That?
==========

Applies To: Washington – Candidate Committees, Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

If you filed a report before March 1, 2023, you’ll have to take additional steps to file amendments, due to the efile format update.

Either before or after you file the amendment, you’ll need to contact the PDC Help Desk and have them update the external\_id of the originally filed report.

To locate this information:

1. Under Reports navigate to Compliance, click the Related Pages button, then select View Previously Generated
2. On the Filed tab, find the originally filed report
3. The first column will have a Report Name that consists of a number followed by a colon and then the name of the database, the report that was generated, and a date range. For example: 7021: TestWA\_CFC\_C3\_2023.02.27
4. The leading number is the Report ID

Once you’ve obtained the report ID, you’ll email the PDC Help Desk (pdc@pdc.wa.gov) and provide the following:

* Your committee ID and number
* The date of the originally filed report – if there is more than one report filed on the date in question, also give the PDC the amount of the C3 being amended
* The Report ID that needs to be updated to the external\_id

Doing so will link the reports on the PDC side, and ensure the amendment will override the originally filed report.

# HOW DO I EXCLUDE RESULTS BASED ON FLAGS USING ADVANCED SEARCH

How Do I Exclude Results Based on Flags Using Advanced Search?

* **Relationship:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** (select the Volunteer flag)

At this point, click the red Add as Exclusion button. The Search Criteria will then show two lines of criteria, one with a red Exclude button. This will create a list that excludes any records with the Flag you chose.

# WHAT ARE RECURRING TRANSACTIONS AND HOW DO I ADD ONE

What Are Recurring Transactions and How Do I Add One?
==========

Recurring Transactions are typically used for any transactions that may regularly occur on the same day of the month, whether it be a regular donor or a monthly expense.

How do I add a recurring transaction?
----------

Under the Accounting tab, select Recurring Transactions. On the resulting screen you’ll see any existing transactions already designated as recurring transactions.

To add a new recurring transaction, click the Add Recurring Transaction button at the bottom of the screen. A new window will appear and will display as any standard transaction add does in ISP. Complete the needed and applicable details of the transaction and click Add Recurring Transaction.

Once added, the transaction will then appear on the main Recurring Transactions screen with any of the following details that were added during the process.

**Transaction Type:** This will tell you what transaction type the recurring transaction it is, whether it’s an Expense or Monetary Contribution or any other type selected when it was created. Click the type to make any edits to the transaction.

**Next Date:** This is the next date the recurring transaction will process and appear as such in your database.

**Name:** This is the entity’s name where the recurring transaction lives.

**Number:** If you added a number, such as a check number, it will display here.

**Budget Category:** Any Budget Category you chose for this transaction will show here.

**Internal Note:** If you added an Internal Note to the recurring transaction, it will show in this column.

**Election:** This is the Election chosen when the recurring transaction was created.

**Amount:** This will display the amount of the recurring transaction, as well as the abbreviation of the Financial Account it is associated with.

To the right of the Amount column are two other icons.

**Message:** If you hover your mouse over this icon, it will display all notes, such as Compliance, Check, and Internal Notes, as well as the Reporting Code used.

**Info:** Hover over this with your mouse to show if the transaction has been cleared via Reconciliation, as well as who created it and/or edited it, if applicable.

Recurring transactions will not be entered when your account is dormant. However, due to timing issues, a transaction set to be added within approximately 24 hours of an account going dormant may still get added. Be sure to review all Recurring transactions prior to the account going Dormant.

If you’d like to change something about all of your recurring transactions at once, click the Bulk Update button at the bottom of the page. This allows you to change the election or financial account associated with them.

==========

The potential for duplicate Individual and Organization records increases as your campaign progresses. Because of this, there are a couple of processes in ISP to help you manage duplicates.

ai@ISP
----------

One of many tasks [ai@ISP](https://ispolitical.com/What-Is-ai-ISP/) is charged with is combining duplicates while you handle other work. To turn on this feature, navigate to the ai@ISP page under the Tools tab. On the resulting page, slide the Auto-Combine Duplicates option to the right to turn it on.

When determining what is a duplicate, ai@ISP will not combine records if there is even a slight doubt they are not duplicates. ai@ISP will combine records only when there is a matching name and matching contact information. Only records that match will be combined overnight. All others will be left for you to manually combine.

Manual Combining
----------

To see the potential duplicates ai@ISP didn’t catch, or if you simply prefer to see which records are potential duplicates, navigate to the Combine Duplicates page under the Tools tab. To set the criteria for the system to search for duplicates, click the Change Method button at the bottom of the screen. In the Duplicate Search Methods window that appears, you’ll see multiple options in the Name Match field drop-down menu. These options allow you to be as strict or loose with the results as possible.

The Name Match options will determine how ai@ISP uses the name fields to determine potential duplicates:

* **A+:** This looks at all the name fields, including name suffixes and prefixes. When used with other contact information, these are almost certainly duplicates.
* **A:** Similar to A+, when used with other contact information, these are almost certainly duplicates but may have problems in rare cases such as “Jr” & “Sr” living together.
* **B:** Simple name matching focusing on first and last names. Use carefully, especially without high-quality contact information matches.
* **C:** This uses a very wide net to find potential duplicates. While it is helpful for dealing with typos and other name variations, this will also have many false positives.

Start with A+ to get the most conservative results, then move through the rest and make your determinations as you move along.

It’s also helpful to mark those that aren’t duplicates as Not Duplicates. You can then exclude them from future searches and results.

Note: In the event that you need to uncombine duplicates that were accidentally combined, you can do so by first navigating to the entity record. Once in the entity record, select Uncombine from the drop-up menu of the Advanced Tools button and then finalize the process in the Uncombine Entity window.

# HOW DO I SET UP PRINT ENVELOPES

How Do I Set Up & Print Envelopes?
==========

The Print Envelopes tool gives you the flexibility of setting necessary return sender details to print on an envelope when sending out mail.

Under the Tools tab, select Print Envelopes. If you do not see this option, select Add/Remove Tools, then scroll down to the Print Envelopes option and click it to add it to your database.

When you land on the Print Envelope Settings page, you’ll see a Customize section. Click the right corner to open the envelope settings window. In the window will be four lines for you to add a return address. You’ll also have the option of using it or not by selecting the Yes or No tab next to Use Return Address. Selecting Yes will place the return address in the top left corner of each envelope you print.

How do I print an envelope?
----------

Once you have the Print Envelope settings created, first navigate to the specific entity’s record you’ll be sending mail to. In the Addresses section, click the hot dog menu to the right of the address you’ll be mailing and choose Print Envelope. You’ll then receive a browser window to save the envelope as a PDF to your computer. Select a location and click to save it.

At this point, load envelopes into your printer. Next, open the PDF of the envelope you want to print. It will display as an envelope with the entity’s address in the middle. If you chose to display the return address on the envelope, you’ll also see this in the top left corner.

Prior to printing, if you notice any needed corrections with the return address, return to the Print Envelopes page and make corrections. However, you will then have to go back to the entity’s record and repeat the print and save process.

# WHY CAN T I SEE THE FEC FORM 3

Why Can’t I See the FEC Form 3?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees, Political Action Committees (PACs)

There are two different types of committees that file the Form 3: candidate committees and joint fundraising committees that only support federal candidates. To get the Form 3 to appear, follow the appropriate directions below for your committee type.

Candidate Committees
----------

If this is for a candidate committee and you can’t see the Form 3 as an available report in the dropdown, there are some additional data entry steps you’ll need to take.

First, you’ll want to ensure your [Committee and Candidate](https://ispolitical.com/what-records-are-needed-for-compliance-reporting/) records are set up. Ensure the following options and data entry are in the Candidate and Committee records.

1. For your candidate’s record:

* Set Office Sought (or Office Held) to: US House of Representatives or US Senate
* Set Office Sought Jurisdiction to: Federal

2. For your committee’s record:

* Set the Committee Info Type: Candidate and Jurisdiction: Federal

PAC – Joint Fundraising Committees
----------

PAC-JFCs that only support federal candidates must file reports using the Form 3. For these PACs:

1. Make sure your filing committee is set as a Political Action Committee in the organization record.

2. Go to the Reports menu and select Compliance. Then select Manage Filers from the Related Pages menu on the bottom.

3. On the Manage Filers page, choose Convert to PAC – Joint Fundraising Committee in the hotdog menu.

# WHAT ARE BUDGET CATEGORIES

What Are Budget Categories?
==========

Tracking your finances and their source is an important part of any campaign. In ISP, Budget Categories are a great way to understand where transactions occur and how they play a role in your committee’s finances.

Under the Lists tab, select Budget Categories. On the resulting screen will be a list of Budget Categories already existing in your database. You can choose to view all Active, Inactive, or All Budget Categories.

To the left of each budget category is a red X that allows you to remove the Budget Category from the list. If it is in use (i.e. at least one transaction has that Budget Category selected), it will instead be made Inactive so it no longer appears in your list of Budget Category options when creating a transaction.

To the right is a hot dog menu with an option to Merge any budget categories that are duplicates of each other.

You can also click on each Budget Category to edit the name and which Parent Category it belongs to. Parent Categories are more global in purpose and can cover multiple similar Budget Categories. For example, you could have an Administrative Parent Category with Budget Categories such as Bookkeeping or Bank Fees linked to the Parent Category.

At the bottom of the screen are other actions you can take.

### Print ###

This will print the list of budget categories to a PDF.

### Import Budget Categories ###

If you handle multiple accounts, you can import in specific budget categories from that account into another. In the window that appears, choose the Category (or Categories), then click Import Budget Categories.

### Delete Unused Categories ###

This will remove any categories that have not been used yet, allowing you to keep your list uncluttered.

### Inactivate Old Categories ###

This is another tool to help keep your list free from categories that are no longer in use. Clicking this will move Active categories that have not been used in a while over to the Inactive designation and list. If you need to reactivate an inactive Budget Category, click on the red Inactive button.

# WHERE DO I FILE AS A LOCAL CA FILER IF THE EFILE REPORT TO LOCAL BUTTON IS NOT AVAILABLE ECAMPAIGN EFS

Where Do I File as a Local CA Filer if the “Efile Report to Local” Button Is Not Available (ECampaign & Efs)?
==========

Applies To: California

Filing your Compliance reports with a Local CA Filing Agency (e.g. City of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara County, etc.) is possible via ISP. There are, however, certain data entry steps to take first.

### Filer/Committee Entity Record ###

First, under Committee Info, ensure Jurisdiction is set appropriately.

– If you need to file with your county, select County.
– If you need to file with a city or town, select City.

In addition, ensure Jurisdiction is filled in with the City or County you are filing with. Examples of data entry possibilities are Orange, Orange County, or City of San Diego.

### Can I file locally with all cities and counties? ###

Short answer, no. If you are a local filer to one of the following local agencies, you cannot use the E-File Report to Local Agency button. There are other systems that can be used such as eCampaign or EFS. To file with these systems, you need to either download the .cal file from our system and upload to your local agency’s website (login page found below), or download the PDF, sign it, and file the paper copy.

# HOW DO I CREATE ACTBLUE CONDUIT TRANSACTION DEPOSIT AFTER AN IMPORT

How Do I Create ActBlue Conduit Transaction Deposit After an Import?
==========

One of the many ways transactions can be received and entered into the ISP system is through the [ActBlue integration](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-an-actblue-integration/). After they have been imported into the system, you have the option of recording the ActBlue conduit (earmark) deposit separate from the rest of the undeposited transactions.

How do I record an ActBlue deposit?
----------

On the Record Deposit screen, you’ll see a list of transactions ready to be deposited. If any of the contributions are part of an ActBlue conduit contribution, ensure the checkbox next to the transaction(s) in question is selected, then click the Record ActBlue Conduit Check button at the bottom of the screen. Note that the Record ActBlue Conduit Check option will not appear unless you have the ActBlue integration installed.

In the window that appears, you’ll have the option of setting the Check Date, Check Amount, Election, and Budget Category.

When determining the date to use for the whole, you should use the day the money was deposited into your account.

When the transaction is saved, it will automatically populate the Transaction Tag field with Conduit – Conduit Check. This will not update the Tag field for Splits. If needed, that must be done separately.

Once you’ve added the applicable details, click the Add button.

This will direct you to the Edit Transaction screen where you’ll need to complete the main transaction details. You’ll notice, however, that most of the main details are filled in, and also the transactions you selected from the Deposit screen are showing as Splits.

After entering in all the details, choose either Save or Save & New at the bottom to finalize and add the ActBlue deposit to the system.

# ABOUT THE CT FORM 3 REPORT

About the CT Form 30 Report
==========

Applies To: Connecticut

The CT Form 30 is used to report Contributions. Connecticut’s E-File system requires you to upload your report via their system using a specific format. To get the e-file you need, generate the report in ISP and download it. Then upload that saved file to [Connecticut’s system](https://seec.ct.gov/eCrisHome/).

If you open the downloaded e-file, you might get a scary looking warning. Don’t worry about it – this is ok! The file is totally safe.

Budgeting is a critical aspect of campaign finance management, and ISP's powerful budgeting tool ensures that you can manage your finances effectively and proactively.

# WHAT ARE CALL TIME SETTINGS

What Are Call Time Settings?
==========

The Call Time Settings page allows you to create a script you and other users in the database can use when contacting entities. This script and other settings can be uniquely created for each user, too.

To the far right of each user is a slider that allows you to Enable or Disable this feature for each user. If enabled, the user will have a Call Time option on the Dashboard and when they click the option to begin, it will navigate to the first entity that has a Reminder set. Within the record itself, the script will be at the top.

In the Settings column, click the [Edit] option to create the script and update the settings.

In the Script & Notes text box type in the script you’d like to use. This can be used for an exact script or even just a bullet list of items to discuss with the entity.

You also have options to only show specific sections of the record when viewing the record in Call Time mode. These settings can be Hidden, Visible, or Add/Edit.

* **Hidden**: This will prevent the section from being seen while working in Call Time mode.
* **Visible**: This will allow the section to be seen but unable to be edited while in Call Time mode.
* **Add/Edit**: This will allow the user to add or edit data in that section while in Call Time mode.

When the desired settings have been added, click the Update Call Time Setting button.

Call Time works in conjunction with [Reminders](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-reminders/). Once you set up Call Time for either yourself or another user, and if there are current or past due Reminders assigned to you or that user, a button will show on the Dashboard allowing entry into Call Time mode. Once you click it, you’ll be taken to the first record in your list of Reminders. After you’ve made your communication with the individual, click the Record Communication button at the bottom of the screen to note your communication.

# WHAT IS AN ALLOCATION TRANSFER

What Is an Allocation Transfer?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Allocation Transfers are for transfers between two different associated filers, State and Federal. These are typically used for the State committee to reimburse the Federal committee for shared expenses.

How do I add an Allocation Transfer?
----------

Allocation Transfers are handled via the Allocations page. Navigate to the Accounting tab, then select Allocations. On the resulting screen you’ll see the various Allocations existing in your database.

To the right of the Allocation, click the Add Allocation Transfer button. A small window will appear and here you can add the details of the transfer you’d like to create. Once ready, click the Add Allocation Transfer button.

When you generate the FEC Form 3X, the Expense transaction added to the State account will pull to Line 18. As long as the State account is tied to the Federal account via Relationships, this will happen automatically.

# BETA COMPLIANCE REPORTS

Beta Compliance Reports
==========

Why am I able to see a BETA Compliance Report?
----------

Compliance reports sometimes require a quick bug fix or update to the report. Once done, it will be placed in BETA mode. If you see a BETA form, the report is still in testing mode but usable before the changes are pushed to the live version of the report.

Only those we have specifically directed to do so should use the form. Using it without our implicit direction could potentially result in potential filing errors. If we haven’t directed you to use the BETA form, use the standard form, as you have not experienced the issue that prompted the work on the beta. The changes, once finalized, will be pushed to the live version of the report.

When filing an amendment, your amendment numbers should be in order. If this is your first amendment, the amendment number should be 1; any subsequent amendments should follow in sequential order. While it is not required, we recommend numbering amendments starting at 1 and proceeding in numerical order so as not to cause confusion or errors in the future.

You will also need your original FEC Filing ID. This can be obtained from the [FEC website](https://www.fec.gov/data/) for your committee. Search for your committee by name or Filing ID in the search box at the top right-hand corner. Once you’ve located your committee’s page, scroll down to Filings and locate the report you are trying to amend. This will contain the original FEC Filing ID, and will inform you of whether you’ve already filed an amendment as well as what number the amendment number should be.

Please double-check the dates you enter in ISP to ensure they match the date range of the original report filed. If your amendment needs a date different than the original, you’ll need a [backdoor password](https://ispolitical.com/about-fec-backdoor-passwords/).

If the original report was filed by paper and the amendment will be filed electronically, the amended report should be filed as an original and the FEC will be able to link the two.

If you’re trying to amend a prior report to be an amendment, generate the report with the Amended box checked and the Report Period set to Termination. The FEC doesn’t allow both the Amended and Termination boxes to be checked, but it’s more important that the report be marked as Termination rather than Amendment. When you generate the report like this, the Amended box will not be checked on the cover page. This is expected and there’s nothing that can be done about this.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of campaign finance in the United States. It's crucial for political treasurers and campaign managers to understand the intricacies of what an FEC filing is to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. This guide will walk you through the essentials of FEC filings, including what they are, who needs to file them, and the important deadlines you need to be aware of.

What is an FEC Filing?
----------

An FEC filing is a report submitted to the Federal Election Commission by political committees, including candidate committees, party committees, and political action committees (PACs). These filings disclose the campaign’s financial activities, including contributions received, expenditures made, and debts incurred. The primary goal is to promote transparency, ethical behavior, and accountability in the electoral process.

Who Needs to File With the FEC?
----------

FEC candidate filings are mandatory for any individual or entity involved in federal elections, including:

* **Candidate Committees:** Individuals running for federal office must register and file periodic reports with the FEC.
* **Party Committees:** National, state, and local party committees must report their financial activities.
* **Political Action Committees (PACs):** PACs, including Super PACs, must file reports on their fundraising and spending.
* **527 Organizations:** These tax-exempt groups must disclose their election-related activities to the FEC.

FEC Filing Deadlines
----------

Understanding the FEC filing deadlines is crucial for compliance. The FEC filing schedule includes regular, periodic filings, and additional reports due before and after elections. Key deadlines include:

* **Quarterly Reports:** Most committees must file quarterly, with deadlines on April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 31.
* **Pre-Election Reports:** Due 12 days before any election in which the committee is involved.
* **Post-Election Reports:** Due 30 days after the general election.
* **Monthly Reports:** Some committees, like national party committees, must file monthly reports.

Failure to adhere to these deadlines can result in significant fines and penalties. Fore more information about filing and deadlines, visit the [FEC website](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/dates-and-deadlines/).

Electronic Filing with the FEC
----------

The FEC encourages committees to use electronic filing, which is faster and more efficient. Committees that raise or spend more than $50,000 in a calendar year are required to file electronically. Benefits of electronic filing include:

* **Speed and Efficiency:** Electronic filings are processed more quickly than paper filings.
* **Immediate Confirmation:** Committees receive immediate confirmation of receipt.
* **Access to Software:** The FEC provides free software to facilitate electronic filing, though you will undoubtedly want to pull your hair out while using it.

For more detailed guidance on electronic filing, visit the [FEC's electronic filing page](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/electronic-filing/).

FAQs
----------

### What happens if I miss an FEC filing deadline? ###

If you miss an FEC filing deadline, your committee may be subject to fines and penalties. The FEC has an [Administrative Fines Program](https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/enforcement/administrative-fines/calculating-administrative-fines/) that assesses penalties based on the length of the delay and the amount of financial activity that was not reported on time. It’s crucial to adhere to all deadlines to avoid these penalties.

### Can I amend an FEC filing after it has been submitted? ###

Yes, you can amend an FEC filing after it has been submitted. If you discover an error or omission in your report, you should file an amendment as soon as possible. The FEC allows for amendments to ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date.

### What is the threshold for mandatory electronic filing? ###

Committees that receive contributions or make expenditures exceeding $50,000 in a calendar year are required to file electronically. This threshold ensures that high-activity committees use the more efficient and accurate electronic filing system.

### How do I register a new committee with the FEC? ###

To register a new committee with the FEC, you need to file a Statement of Organization ([Form 1](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/policy-guidance/fecfrm1i.pdf)). This form provides basic information about your committee, such as its name, address, and the names of the treasurer and other key officers. You must file this form within 10 days of raising or spending more than $1,000 in contributions or expenditures.

### What types of contributions need to be reported in FEC filings? ###

All types of contributions need to be reported in FEC filings, including monetary donations, in-kind contributions (goods and services), loans, and advances. Each type of contribution has specific reporting requirements, and it is important to provide detailed information about the source, amount, and date of each contribution.

Compliance and Best Practices
----------

To ensure compliance with FEC rules and regulations:

* **Stay Informed:** Regularly check the FEC’s website for updates on filing requirements and deadlines.
* **Use Software Solutions:** Employ campaign accounting software, like [ISPolitical](https://ispolitical.com/), to automate and streamline the filing process.
* **Consult with Experts:** Consider hiring a compliance expert or legal advisor to help navigate complex regulations. Compliance deadlines and requirements are built-in to ISPolitical’s [political campaign accounting software](https://ispolitical.com/).

By staying informed and leveraging the right tools, campaign treasurers can manage their FEC filings effectively, ensuring their campaigns remain compliant and transparent. Political campaign accounting software that integrates with the FEC reporting platform while keeping users informed about reporting requirements and deadlines is invaluable; it’s probably the best investment a campaign can make to ensure their campaign is ship shape and above board. Learn more about how this kind of software can enhance and safeguard your campaign [here](https://ispolitical.com/).

# NEW YORK JANUARY PERIODIC SETTINGS

New York January Periodic Settings
==========

Applies To: New York

The NY January Periodic is unique because the From Date is in one year, but the To Date is in another. The state’s e-filing system is also overly complicated and specific, so there are some unique challenges when filing the January Periodic.

Generating the Report
----------

When generating the NY January Periodic Report, keep the following in mind:

* If filing a semi-annual report, then the start date is 07/14/20XX
* If participation in the November 20XX election occurred, then the start date is 12/01/20XX
* For either start date, the end date is 01/12/20XX
* The Report Due Date is 01/16/20XX
* The Election Period is 20XX January Periodic

Note: the e-filing must be generated and downloaded from ISP.

Filing the Report via the NY State System
----------

Once logged into the NY State System, click the hamburger menu on the top bar and select Import Disclosure Reports.

Select Report Year: 20XX (this is the year that the report files; not the year that the majority of the report covers) and click Apply.

When the window refreshes, select Import on the right side towards the middle of the page. In the new pop-up, select ISPolitical for Vendor. Next, click Choose File, then find and upload the file downloaded from ISP. Finally, click Upload.

After some time – it takes a few minutes to upload/process – a message will appear that says “Transactions uploaded successfully. Please review your Disclosure report for accuracy and submit.” Click OK, then select Close in the pop-up window.

Once again, from the hamburger menu, select View/Submit Disclosure, then select an option from EACH drop-down menu on the left side. Ensure once again that the Report Year is 20XX.

After everything is filled in, click Apply and review the report. There are a few options: either review the itemized transactions as listed on the state’s website or print a Full Period Report to review the PDF.

Once the report has been reviewed, click Submit Disclosure Report.

There may be additional steps after this point, depending on the message(s) received upon submission.

# WHAT ARE LEVIN FUNDS AND HOW DO I ADD THEM

What Are Levin Funds and How Do I Add Them?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Levin funds are donations from sources ordinarily prohibited by federal law but permitted by state law. The name is a generic term for the bank account that is used for mixed State and Federal money for specific transactions. Please note while not commonly used, Levin transactions are only on the FEC Form 3X (Party) report.

The first step in creating Levin funds in ISP is to make sure the financial account(s) associated with the Levin transaction is marked for accepting Levin funds. Under the Lists tab, go to Financial Accounts. For the account that will be tied to the Levin fund(s), click the name of the account and in the window that appears, check the box labeled Is For Levin.

Next, when adding or editing transactions meant as Levin funds, be sure to use the Financial Account you have marked for use with Levin funds. If needed, you can also associate and appropriate Allocation with a Levin allocation.

If a transaction is associated with a Levin account, the transaction will pull to the appropriate Levin schedule (L-A or L-B) on the FEC Form 3X (Party).

# HOW DO I USE RELATIONSHIPS TO ADD NEW INDIVIDUALS COPY CONTACT INFO

How Do I Use Relationships to Add New Individuals & Copy Contact Info?
==========

If you receive a contribution from a couple and both people are in a single entity record, this will create warnings and errors if you need to file this contribution on a compliance report. You can use the Relationships section to split them into two records by adding a new individual and copying over the contact information at the same time.

First, from within the record, click the Add icon in the top right corner of the Relationships section as if you are going to add a new Relationship. In the window that appears, type in the name of one of the two individuals involved in the Affiliated field. For example, if the record was for Mary and Bill Jones, you could type in Mary Jones. The system will search for this entity and if not found will provide an option to add a new individual.

When you click Add New Individual, more options will appear that will allow you to determine what data you want added to the new record you’re creating.

If the existing record contains contact information, such as Address or Phone, you’ll be able to click each tab and select a check box for which piece of data to add to the new record. When ready, click Add Relationship. This will not only create a new record for the new individual but link them in the Relationships section.

At this point, the final step is to edit the name of the record to contain only one of the individuals. In the example above, since Mary Jones was created as a separate record, you would update the name to be Bill Jones instead of Mary and Bill Jones.

# WHAT ARE FEC SYSTEM ERRORS AND HOW DO I FIX THEM

What Are FEC System Errors and How Do I Fix Them?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Sometimes the FEC system goes down or errors out when accepting a report. First, read the error. They’re not always clearly written but can have useful information. These errors are different than those in ISP when generating the report.

If you’re still unsure or having trouble, a screenshot is always a good idea to demonstrate best efforts to file. This will come in handy if you need to have a discussion with folks at the FEC or with us.

Finally, remember, it can take several hours for reports to show up on the FEC website. If yours doesn’t show up by the morning after your attempt, at that point it’s worth contacting your analyst with the FEC.

**SYSTEM ERROR: SOMETHING WENT WRONG, PLEASE CONTACT ELECTRONIC FILING OFFICE:** Your best bet is to try filing again. In fact, filing again is always a great way to go.

**FILING ALREADY IN PROCESS!!!! POSSIBLE DUPLICATE SUBMISSION:** If you see this message, they have received your filing.

**Agency Response: fparse returned with error.:** This is an internal FEC error directly from the agency. Please try filing again and if you get the possible duplicate message above, your first report was in fact submitted.

These errors may occur when uploading your report.

# PROHIBITED INKIND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ALLOCABLE ACTIVITIES

Prohibited Inkind Contributions for Allocable Activities
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

The FEC Form 3x allows for Prohibited Inkind Contributions for Allocable Activities. This is when an Inkind contribution, which typically would not be permissible due to FEC regulations, is accepted by the Non-Federal account, and the federal account pays for its share.

The FEC is expecting 3 transactions on the report for each of these Inkinds:

1. On the H3, an allocation transfer from Non-Federal to Federal
2. On the H4, a 100% Non-Federal Use of Prohibited Inkind Contribution
3. On the H4, a 100% Federal Share of Prohibited Inkind Contribution

To do this in ISP, there are 3 data entry steps you need to take.

Prior to adding the transaction, if you haven’t already, first [create the appropriate allocation](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-allocations-appear-on-the-fec-form-3x-report/).

Next, add an Inkind contribution associated with the Non-Federal filer using the appropriate allocation.

Finally, add an Allocation Transfer from the Federal Account to the Non-Federal Account associated with the same allocation as the Inkind in the amount of the Federal Share of the Inkind transaction amount. Using a simple example, if the allocation ratio is 50%, and the Inkind is for $1000, the Allocation Transfer from Federal to Non-Federal would be for $500.

On the Form 3X, the Inkind contribution is reported twice: once on the H3 as a Transfer From Non-Federal to Federal and again on the H4 as the 100% Non-Federal Use of Prohibited Inkind Contribution. (All Inkind contributions are reported twice, both as a receipt and a disbursement, so as to not impact the cash on hand.)

The allocation transfer of the Federal share will appear on the H4, as the 100% Federal Share of Prohibited Inkind Contribution.

In today's competitive political landscape, successful campaigns hinge on strategic fundraising efforts. With data analytics, campaign teams can refine their strategies, identify potential donors, and maximize contributions more effectively than ever. Let’s explore how political campaigns can utilize campaign analytics tools to streamline fundraising efforts and drive success.

Understanding Campaign Analytics
----------

Campaign analytics encompass the political campaign data analysis processes used to evaluate performance, identify opportunities, and optimize fundraising efforts. This includes analyzing past donor data, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into potential future contributors. This is made a lot easier when your accounting software is highly integrated with all aspects of your campaign.

Using Campaign Analytics Tools
----------

Tools for data analytics for political campaigns provide a suite of functionalities designed to streamline and optimize fundraising:

* **Data Tracking:** Tools like ISPolitical's web-based accounting & [fundraising](https://ispolitical.com/fundraising/) platform offer comprehensive tracking of campaign data. This includes monitoring donations, potential donors, historical contributors, and various interest groups. For instance, campaign teams can track animal lovers or sports enthusiasts and target them with specific fundraising emails based on those interests.
* **Reporting:** Good campaign analytics tools provide instant access to donation data, allowing teams to monitor and evaluate fundraising efforts. This immediate insight into contributions from call sheets, drip email campaigns, and other initiatives enables agile adjustments and more strategic planning. If your political accounting software doesn’t have these capabilities, it may be time to consider a more [robust tool](https://ispolitical.com/).
* **Micro & Macro Targeting:** Campaign teams can leverage data analytics software to create both micro and macro-targeted fundraising lists. These lists are based on donor interests, demographics, and past contributions, allowing campaigns to tailor their outreach efforts for maximum impact. Having a tool that keeps track of this data while integrating with all your campaign tools is invaluable.

Boosting Contributions with Data Analytics for Political Campaigns
----------

### Identifying Potential Donors Using Analytics ###

Political campaigns can use data analytics software to segment potential donors based on past contributions, interests, and demographics. This segmentation helps to craft targeted messages that resonate with each group. For example, a campaign might send a dog-loving candidate's picture to potential donors who love animals, pairing it with a compelling fundraising ask.

### Optimizing Fundraising Efforts Using Analytics ###

Data analytics helps campaigns optimize their fundraising strategies by:

* **Refining messaging:** By using political campaign data analysis, teams can assess the effectiveness of past messaging strategies and tailor future messages accordingly. For instance, they can identify the types of appeals that resonate most with specific donor groups, increasing the likelihood of contributions.
* **Streamlining operations:** Campaign analytics tools allow teams to integrate third-party fundraising processors, including Winred, Actblue, Efundraising, Anedot, and Nationbuilder. This integration simplifies the donation process, reducing friction for donors and increasing the likelihood of contributions.

Reporting and Analysis
----------

Because of the vast kinds of data that analytics tools amass, using analytics to pull specific information that should be included on specific reports makes sense. Data analytics software provides instant reporting capabilities, offering comprehensive insights into the success of fundraising efforts:

* **Tracking:** Campaign teams can monitor contributions, assess the effectiveness of specific initiatives and making data-driven adjustments.
* **Custom Reports:** Pulling out the data that needs to be reported to specific political entities in order to remain transparent is easy with the right software. ISPolitical’s software is fully customizable, and reports can be automated so you never miss a beat!
* **Legacy donor management:** Analytics tools also help campaigns maintain relationships with previous donors, keeping track of their contributions and engagement levels. This aids in nurturing long-term support, ensuring sustained fundraising success.

Why Data Analytics for Political Campaigns Matters
----------

Political campaigns that embrace data analytics gain a competitive edge by:

* **Making informed decisions:** Access to comprehensive campaign data provides insights into donation patterns, campaign performance metrics, and donor preferences, enabling teams to tailor their fundraising strategies. This data-driven approach allows campaigns to allocate resources more effectively, focusing on high-impact initiatives and maximizing returns.
* **Building stronger relationships:** By maintaining communication and cultivating relationships with legacy donors, campaigns can ensure long-term support and financial stability. ISPolitical’s [fundraising software](https://ispolitical.com/fundraising/) integrates seamlessly with your email and text programs to make communications based on historic relationships easier.
* **Staying agile:** Insights allow campaign teams to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, ensuring they stay ahead of the competition. This also helps you to stay super responsive when public news or new information can affect your campaign.

Are You Utilizing Political Campaign Data Analysis in Your Campaigns?
----------

Like any industry, the political sphere has become increasingly data-driven. If you aren’t making use of tools that help collect and analyze the data that affects your campaigns, you are missing out on potential opportunities.

Data analytics software is revolutionizing political campaign fundraising, offering tools and insights that help teams identify potential donors, optimize fundraising efforts, and build lasting relationships.

By embracing campaign analytics tools like the ones that are built into ISPolitical's [political accounting software](https://ispolitical.com/), campaigns can access their full fundraising potential.

# WHAT IS HOUSEHOLDING AND HOW DO I CREATE A HOUSEHOLDED LIST

What Is Householding and How Do I Create a Householded List?
==========

In ISP, you can link spouses and create a household. This means there are two individuals with their own records in your database but live at the same address. The reasons for keeping them separate can vary but one reason to link them as spouses is for mailing purposes. This will allow you to avoid sending two pieces of mail to the same address.

The first thing to ensure is [you have spouses linked](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-link-spouses/) in your database. If this has been done already or after this step has been taken, the next thing to do is create a Custom Export for households.

1. Navigate to the Advanced Search page under the Add/Search tab.
2. At the bottom of the resulting screen, click the blue Custom Exports button.
3. Click the Add Custom Export Format button at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the window that appears, first give the custom export a name.
5. Next, select your desired checkbox options. At the very least you’ll want For Advanced Search checked.
6. In the Area dropdown, choose Households.
7. In the Available column will be two options, Household Name and Household Nickname. Click either or both to add them to the Selected column.
8. If you’d like other data to pull to the export, choose other options from the Area dropdown and continue to move what you want from Available to Selected.
9. Once you’re ready, click Add Custom Export Format.

Household Name: This will either be the name of the single individual in the household OR the housedhold name of the two individuals linked as Spouses (e.g. Bob and Mary Jones).
Household Nickname: This will be the first name of either the single individual in the household OR the first names of the two individuals linked as Spouses (e.g. Bob and Mary).

After you add the custom export format, on the main Custom Exports screen you’ll see the Custom Export format you just created in the Name column. If you want to make any edits, click the name to reopen the window and make changes.

At the bottom of the screen, click the blue Advanced Search button to be returned back to the Advanced Search screen. From here, build out your query and run your search. When you’re ready to export the data using the household custom export you just built, click the Exports & Actions button and a menu will appear. Towards the top will be Excel: Custom Export and if you click that, to the right the custom export you built will appear. Click that to begin exporting the data of the search you just ran to the household custom export.

When creating the Custom Export, you had the checkbox options of also using the custom export format for Thank Yous and the Transactions Report. The next time you generate those reports you’ll see the option for the household custom export format as an export option.

# HOW DO I USE THE ACTBLUE QUICK IMPORT

How Do I Use the ActBlue Quick Import?
==========

When it comes to getting ActBlue data into your ISP software database, there are multiple ways of making that happen. In this help file we’re going to cover the Quick Import tool for importing ActBlue transactions into your database manually.

Generally speaking, while the Quick Import tool is easier from an accounting standpoint, you can also use the [Integration tool](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-an-actblue-integration/) to allow for real-time information rather than having to wait to perform the periodic upload via Quick Imports.

### How do I import ActBlue transactions using Quick Import? ###

On the Quick Imports screen, select ActBlue Online Donations in the Format menu. On the right, in the About section, you’ll see the order in which the columns need to be in in order for the data to be mapped correctly in the database. We have included a template for you to use so all you have to do is copy and paste data into it, then import that file. Click the Download Template link at the bottom of the About section. If you save the template to your computer, you can continue to re-use this same template, just copy and paste the data you want imported into the spreadsheet each time.

### What upload options should I choose? ###

ActBlue could have sent this money to you in two different ways: a check or a transfer directly to your bank account (Automatic Clearing House or ACH).

If it was ACH, select the Financial Account the money was deposited into when selecting upload options.

However, if you received a check, select Undeposited. (If you have multiple filers in your database, be sure to select the correct filer tied to the Undeposited option.) You’ll then include the check in the [deposit batch](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-create-actblue-conduit-transaction-deposit-after-an-import/) when you do a deposit, which may or may not include other checks that you received at the same time.

### What is the Import as Conduit – Conduit Check Splits option? ###

The FEC, and most state agencies, require that you report ActBlue was the intermediary. Checking this box will allow for that to happen in the database.

However, if ActBlue acts more as an invisible-like credit card processor, do not check the box. In this instance, your donors will be entered as individual contributions, similar to as if they had written checks directly to you. If you have questions, contact ActBlue or your filing agency.

For detailed information on creating ActBlue deposits after your import, click [here](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-create-actblue-conduit-transaction-deposit-after-an-import/).

# HOW DO I REPORT A TRANSFER FROM A JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE JFC TO JOINT FUNDRAISING PARTICIPANTS

How Do I Report a Transfer From a Joint Fundraising Committee (JFC) To Joint Fundraising Participants?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Political Action Committees (PACs)

When a Joint Fundraising Committee (JFC) transfers net proceeds to joint fundraising participants, it is reported as a Transfer to Affiliated Committees on Line 22 of the FEC Form 3X. If your JFC committee files a Form 3, it would be reported as a Transfer to Other Authorized Committee on Line 18.

2. Transfer disbursements to the joint fundraising participants must include the reporting code of 011—Political Contributions.

# NH R AND E CANDIDATE VERSION LINE BY LINE

NH R and E (Candidate Version) Line by Line
==========

Applies To: New Hampshire

NOTES:

* NH efiling does not support the concept of splits or memos. Typically states want to see where the money originated/ended up, so we itemize splits as cash-impact transactions, and do not itemize the whole/parent transaction.
* NH efiling does not support the concept of negative transactions, so they are listed as positive receipts on the opposite schedule. (ie: reversed receipts as positive expenses; reversed expenses as positive receipts)

Rocket is an installable Android app that allows you to manage your ISP call time queue, track progress, and follow up with donors and constituents. It’s ideal for candidates, fundraisers, and other campaign staff who want to go through a call list on their phones or away from a computer.

The Rocket App is based on Reminders added to records in ISP. Any record with a Reminder assigned to you with a date matching the current day or older will be available. As you go through each contact that appears on your phone, you’ll have the option to add a note with the result of that call, indicate a pledge amount, and set up a follow-up reminder, if necessary. These actions can be done directly from the Rocket App and appear automatically on the matching record in ISP.

How Do I Turn On and Set up the Rocket App?
----------

To use the app with the [Call Time](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-call-time-and-how-do-i-use-it/) or [Reminder](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-reminders/) functionality in ISP, navigate to the Tools tab and select Add/Remove Tools, then scroll to the Rocket Management listing. Click it to begin the installation process. Once installed, it will show as a new menu option under the Tools tab.

From the Rocket Management page, click Generate Token to get started. This will send a text to the phone number associated with your user account in ISP. The text message will contain a link to download and install the app on your Android phone. You will likely get a few warnings about setting changes and permissions. That is an expected security function of Android. Be sure to make any needed changes indicated by your Android phone to allow the app to be installed and function as intended.

Once the app is installed, it will ask for an authorization token. This is the token you generated on the Rocket Management page in ISP. The token shown will disappear when it has expired after 10 minutes. If that time lapses, click Generate New Token to show a new token for use in authorizing the Rocket app.

# HOW DO I ENTER CREDIT CARD PURCHASES

How Do I Enter Credit Card Purchases?
==========

If your committee is carrying a credit card balance, it’s important to ensure the data entry is correct. This will save time and trouble when it comes to reporting this information. Typically, Credit Card expenses are considered a type of debt and not a regular expense. However, this may vary per your filing agency.

The simplest way for both data entry and for reporting is to look at each individual month as its own separate debt, or Accrued Expense.

There are a handful of pointers to keep in mind when it comes to credit card accrued expenses.

1. Treat each month that is not paid off in full as a new accrued expense.

2. Payments are standard payments on accrued expenses.

3. Each purchase that makes up the total amount accrued that month should be entered as a split on the accrued expense.

4. Interest charges are just like any other split, but to the credit card company. They will appear on the statement they showed up on and should be reported.

Here’s an example and how all this would apply.

If you accrue a $1000 balance in credit card bills in April and made a $100 payment, that would reduce the April Accrued Expense total down to $900. Then, if another $1000 in credit card bills is accrued in May, you would have two accrued expenses: April’s balance would be $900 and May’s would be $1000. If you paid $200 more off in May, you could apply that payment to one credit card accrued expense or split between both. How, or if it is split, does not matter overall as long as the total payments are correct.

Using the example above, let’s include interest charges. For May, you accrued a $90 interest charge and this shows on your May statement. Given that the $1000 accrued in May includes the $90 interest charge, you would enter the splits as usual, including a $90 split for the interest charge, just as if it was any other expense on the card.

# WHAT ARE PENDING IMPORTS AND HOW DO I PROCESS THEM

What Are Pending Imports and How Do I Process Them?
==========

Nearly all of the Integrations in ISP use the Pending Imports system. This means when transactions are created in other programs integrated with your ISP database, the transactions will appear in an import queue found on your Dashboard.

If there are any transactions and records to import, there will be a small section on your Dashboard indicating this. In this section is a toggle switch for Email Notifications. This turns sets the ability to receive notifications of pending transactions to be imported. If you do not see this section on your Dashboard, this indicates you have no transactions or data to import.

When you click the Click to Process button, you’ll be directed to a new screen called Pending Import Matches. Here you’ll see pending imports and potential matches with already existing records in your database.

### Import Options ###

At the top of the screen are four drop down menus: Set Non Pre-Set Financial Accounts, Election, Budget Category, and Event. These options are determined by what’s already in your database on those pages. Please note that Election and Budget Category are required. Below those menus are options to mark the transactions as thanked upon import and import the transactions as Undeposited.

When it comes to these menus and options, they are considered sticky. This means the options you use now will automatically be there for the next import. You can change them each time but what you change to now will be considered the preferred options next time.

### Pending Imports ###

In the Pending Import section will be the entity and transaction information, as well as any potential record matches. If there are potential matches, you will have options to Import, Add As New, Skip For Now, and Delete & Do Not Import. There is also an option for Custom Import which allows you to have more control over what information is used when combining the matched records upon import.

If you want to select one single option for all imports, you’ll see an Options dropdown in the top right corner of this section. This will set the same import option for all pending import transactions and individuals.

When you have selected your options and are ready for import, click the Process Import button at the bottom of the screen.

Keep in mind when it comes to imports:

Temporary duplicate contact information is normal & expected with imports. They should get automatically cleaned up as part of the cleanup process. This typically runs within an hour of the import.

About AI Imports
----------

1.  ISP will automatically filter out known common fake email addresses during the import process. For example: noreply@noreply.com and test@test.com. If you have common addresses that should be blocked from import to your database, please let us know.
2. AI’s import assumption is that newly provided information is correct. For example: If John Doe previously worked at “American Airlines” and then went to work at “Delta Airlines”, AI would assume that the new information provided was correct.
3. If a budget category is submitted via the API, then that takes precedence over a selected budget category when doing an import. That applies to both AI imports and human imports.

# HOW DO I REPORT AUCTION ITEMS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES ON FEC REPORTS

How Do I Report Auction Items and Proceeds From Sales on FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When it comes to FEC reports, auction items are reported as a monetary contribution. A compliance note of Proceed From Sale is required for any goods and services are sold. This is required for both House or Senate committees, and the receipt will be reported as a proceed from those sales.

For example, in the event of a fundraising item or ticket to a fundraising event, the full purchase price will be considered a contribution. House and Senate committee will report having received those contributions on Form 3, Schedule A, the same process as a monetary contribution to the committee. Reports for Individuals, Party Committees, PACs, and other political committees are dependent on the contributor type.

**Sale of Assets**

House and Senate Candidates will report their receipts from sales or lease assets for what the total amount is. In the event a House or Senate Committee sold either a good or service for a difference in price, the difference will be considered an in-kind contribution to the recipient committee.

# ABOUT THE GA CCDR REPORT

About the GA CCDR Report
==========

Applies To: Georgia

The Georgia Campaign Contribution Disclosure Report requires all active filers to report contributions received of any amount. Expenditures of all amounts are to be reported on the Expenditures Made.

* **Section 1:** The Report Type is determined by the Amended box on the criteria screen. If this is unchecked, the Original box will be checked on the report.
* **Section 2:** The candidate Office and Filer ID will appear here. If it is not a candidate committee, the committee name and Filer ID will pull.
* **Section 3:** This section contains the full name, street address, and other contact info for the committee. The date and time the report was generated will also show. To add the Committee Chairperson and Treasurer names, be sure they are linked via the Relationships section in the committee’s record. For the Committee Chairperson, the Relationship option is called Principal Officer.

# HOW DO I CREATE A SCHEDULED REPORT

How Do I Create a Scheduled Report?
==========

The Scheduled Reports page allows you to schedule reports to be sent to you and/or other staff members automatically. The reports you can schedule are found on the Financial Reports page and also the Compliance Tools page.

To begin, click the Add Scheduled Report at the bottom of the screen. In the window that appears, click the Report dropdown to view the reports you can schedule.

When setting the report criteria, you’ll have five general options to set no matter which report you choose:

* **Frequency:** You can choose to have the report sent anywhere from daily to monthly, as well as a certain amount of times.
* **Time Zone:** This determines the time zone in which the report needs to be generated and sent, and is typically determined by the recipient’s location.
* **Starting:** This is the date you want the report to start. If you click in the field, you’ll see a calendar date picker, as well as a list of specific time options.
* **Send If Blank:** If the report does not contain any details, this checkbox option allows you to choose whether or not to send the report. Sometimes it’s helpful to know nothing has changed, either for information’s sake or as a flag something might be wrong.
* **Recipients:** This determines who will be receiving the report. The recipient must be a user in the database with a valid email address.

Once you select the type of report you want to schedule, you’ll see a Report Options section appear. These options will be dependent on which report you choose and may vary.

If you have multiple Filers in your database, you can choose which filer the report’s data will come from. There are also From and To Date fields that help you determine the time parameters of the report.

For some reports, such as the Transactions report, you’ll see further options. These can include Budget Categories, Transaction Types, and the Columns you want included on the export.

Once you’ve set the criteria, click the Add Scheduled Report button. You’ll be redirected back to the main Manage Scheduled Reports page where all the scheduled reports and their details are listed.

# HOW DO I GENERATE AND E FILE WITH THE FEC

How Do I Generate and E-file With the FEC?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Filing compliance reports is an important part of any campaign. In ISP, you can both generate and directly e-file your report with the FEC.

Before you begin, it’s essential you have your e-filing password on hand. The FEC should have provided this to you when you registered your campaign. If you do not have this, then you can contact the FEC or [request a password online](https://webforms.fec.gov/psa/newrequest.htm).

### How do I generate my FEC report? ###

This is a general outline of steps to generate your report. Please note that different FEC reports may have different fields and drop-down menus.

1. Navigate to Reports, then to Compliance.

2. If you have multiple Filers in your database, then choose which Filer you are filing the report for. If you do not see this drop-down menu, then it is because you only have one Filer.

3. Select the Compliance Report you want to generate, as well as the Compliance Report Version, if applicable.

4. Fill out the remaining fields according to the report you are generating. All fields with an asterisk are required.

### From Date ###

This is the start date of the reporting period.

### To Date ###

This is the end of the reporting period.

### Current Election ###

Select the current election you are in. If you are filling out this form as a PAC, you may be selecting Non-Election here.

### Previous General Election Date ###

Enter the date of the last general election. If you have not had a prior general election, use the last known general election date. If you receive an error stating there is a calculation discrepancy with the current Election Cycle to Date total, confirm the date you are using matches the date used on previously generated reports. A different date can create this discrepancy.

### Amended ###

Click this box if you are filing an amendment. There will be some additional information fields to fill out as well.

### Original Report Number ###

This is the FEC report’s ID number on the report you are amending. It can be located on the FEC website or in the confirmation you received.

### Number of Amendments ###

If this is your first amendment to the report you would enter 1 here. If you have had several amendments to the same report, you will want to make sure this number is higher than the last one.

### Change of Address ###

Checking this will mark the Change of Address box on the FEC Form.

### Report Period ###

Select the report name you are filing. (e.g. April Quarterly, Year End, etc.)

### Previous Unitemized Individual Donations ###

You can find this number on Line 11aii, Column B of your previously filed FEC report. If you have not previously filed an FEC Form 3 or 3x, then you should put 0 here.

### Sort Order ###

There are several options for sorting the data on the report. By date is most common.

### Note ###

This is for any additional information or notes that you need to attach to your filing. This will create a new Notes page after the Summary pages.

Once you have entered all of the fields that you need, click the Generate button at the bottom of the screen. The system will gather the required information and display a list of errors and warnings, if any. Fatal errors may block you from filing, but most warnings will not. However, filing with missing information is usually not advised.

Each error and warning is a link that, when clicked, will open the record information on the right part of the screen for easy editing. Please note, however, that after you make your changes, you will need to regenerate the report in order for those changes to take effect and to remove the warning or error.

After the report is generated, you’ll have download options at the bottom of the page. Click on the Download button to get PDF or E-filing versions of the report.

Once you are comfortable that there are no problems with your report, click on E-File Report. The FEC also has a [manual upload site](https://efoservices.fec.gov/webload). Should you need to, you can use this site to upload a .fec file from ISP instead of using the filing feature in ISP. Clicking the E-File option from the Download menu will provide the .fec file.

### How do I e-file my report? ###

Once your report is generated, you’ll see an E-File Report button at the bottom of the page. If your report has Fatal errors, you will not see this button until those errors are corrected.

Clicking the E-file Report button shows a new E-File section with an E-Filing Password field. Enter your FEC filing password in this field. If you’d like to save the password to a Password Safe, then check the box below the password field. This will save the password for future reports that need to be filed.

Once you have entered your FEC filing password, click the Submit Report button to file your report with the FEC.

After you receive confirmation from the FEC that the file was accepted, make sure to click the Mark as Filed button. This will lock the transactions involved with this report to help preserve data integrity.

# WHAT IS MAGIC MATCH AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Magic Match and How Do I Use It?
==========

Magic Match is a featured option for use with the integrations, Anedot, WinRed and ActBlue, in conjunction with the Quick Import Tool to bring over contributions from these processors without creating duplicate transactions in your database.

### Why is Magic Match So Useful? ###

Clients can import the same data twice, via the two methods, but without duplicating entries into their database. This eliminates potential errors before they occur.

### How does Magic Match Work?
###

Magic Match is a check box that will appear when the Anedot, WinRed or ActBlue Quick Import format is selected. When this option is selected it will catch duplicate transactions in the import without adding them to the database. Instead, only the record will be updated with the new transaction. It will also include the deposit batch information.

### Why would someone use Magic Match? ###

When data comes in through an integration, it’s missing two pieces of key info for proper accounting: fees and deposit batches. Importing the same data through Quick Import with Magic Match allows the system to automatically group transactions together in batches, as well as add the appropriate fees.

* **Fund Transfers:** Use this schedule group for any transfers from and to your committee.
* **Itemized Expenditures:** Use this schedule group for any expenditures made by your committee.
* **Itemized Distributions:** Use this schedule group for any disbursements to any entity during the reporting period.

# HOW DO I CAPTURE VIDEO WITH WINDOWS 1

How Do I Capture Video With Windows 10?
==========

Sometimes it’s helpful for Support and other staff to see visually with video what issue you’re encountering. If you are **Windows 10** user, you already have a video capture tool built in to your system. Here’s how you can access and use it to send us video of the error or problem you’re encountering.

*Please be aware there may be slight variations on different versions of Windows.*

To begin, press the **Windows** key and the **letter G** at the same time. The background will darken some and several sections will appear.

Locate the section labeled **Capture**. If you do not see this section, click the **Widget Menu** at the top (second option from the left) and click **Capture**.

In the **Capture** section you’ll see several options denoted by icon. The camera is for taking a screen shot but what we’re looking for in the video capture is the **small circle recording button**.

If you’d like audio in your video, just to the right of the audio record button is a microphone icon. If there is a line through it, no audio will be captured in the video. Click it to remove the line and include audio in the video.

When you’re ready to begin, click the audio record button. A section will then appear on the right called **Capture Status**, and a timer will start counting. At this point, back in your database, take the steps you were taking previously when you encountered your issue.

When you finish, in the **Capture Status** section, click the **blue circle with white square** in it to end the video capture. To view the video, back in the **Capture** section, click the ***“Show all captures”***  option. A new section will appear and show you a gallery of all the videos you’ve captured, including the one you just recorded.

In that window you can rename it by clicking the pencil icon, as well as open the file location on your computer or simply delete it if you’re not happy with it and want to try again.

# WHAT IS ADVANCED SEARCH AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Advanced Search and How Do I Use It?
==========

Advanced Search allows you to create and run detailed and specific searches on various data points in your database. The results you receive via Advanced Search will be record-based. This means that when using this search method, you search for entities (Individuals and Organizations). If you are looking for specific transaction searches, [Financial Reports](https://ispolitical.com/how-to-generate-financial-reports/) will handle these needs.

There are two parts to Advanced Search: (1) searching for entities, and (2) using your search results.

### (1) Searching for Entities ###

Advanced Search has four different modes for searching: Power Mode, Communication Filters, Contribution Filters, and Other Favorites. Contribution Filters and Other Favorites allow for quick and easy searching of common fields. Power Mode, however, is generally the mode to utilize as you begin your Advanced Search.

### **Power Mode**   ###

This function provides full system functionality and enables a search with robust criteria options. As with all four search modes, the Add Rule section is where you select the criteria that determine your results. In Power Mode, the following four fields appear under the Add Rule section header:

* **Area:** In the Select an area drop-down menu, choose from elements of an entity’s record, e.g., Addresses, Contributions, Flags, Key Stats.
* **Field:** In the Select a field drop-down menu, you will choose an option that is a subset of the chosen Area. For example, if you selected Addresses, you could select State.
* **Relationship:** In the Select a relationship drop-down menu, choose how to define the chosen Field further. For example, if you selected State and want only to find Addresses within a particular State, you would select Is Any of; in contrast, if you want to exclude Addresses from a specific State, you would select Is Not Any of.
* **Value:** Click in this box to access the drop-down menu. This is where you will either type the data point (e.g., the name of the State) or choose from a list of provided data points.

Once you have created your query, click the Add Rule button. This action will copy your selected criteria from the Add Rule section and paste it into the Search Criteria section. In many instances, this is the point at which you can click the Run Search button to complete your Advanced Search.

If your query is more complex, you may need to utilize one or more of the other three buttons.

The Add as Exclusion button will direct the system not to include any entities found with the criteria selected. After you click to add the rule, the buttons New Search Group and Add Compound Rule appear. These are advanced features that are used for more complex searches.

On the far left of the rule is an Edit button. Clicking this pulls the rule back into the Add Rule section to make changes. On the far right of the rule is a red X, which will remove the rule entirely from the Search Criteria section.

### **Communications Filters**  ###

This mode allows you to search entities based solely on communication information.

You can select any Communication Type(s) within your chosen date range on this page.

### **Contribution Filters**  ###

This mode allows you to search entities based solely on contribution information.

When using this mode, you can determine how the system searches for contribution information within a record. These are Total Contributions, Most Recent Contribution, and Any Contribution. You can also narrow down search results based on Date Range, Amount Range, and Election.

When you’ve chosen or entered all the criteria, you’ll again have the buttons described above to add the rule to the Search Criteria section.

### **Other Favorites**  ###

This mode is used for other Address and Flag-related results.

This mode allows you to select from various Address and Flag-related data points. For example, you can determine your results based on City, County, ZIP Code, and State. Use the Flags field to locate entities that have specific flags.

When you’ve chosen or entered all the criteria, you’ll again have the buttons described above to add the rule to the Search Criteria section.

### (2) Using Your Search Results ###

You have several options for using your results, including displaying, exporting, and bulk updating the data. Most options are found on the Exports & Actions menu:

* **Run Search:** Generates the search results directly on the screen.
* **Excel: Custom Export:** Select any Custom Export spreadsheet formats you’ve created.
* **Call Sheets:** Generates PDF pages of the results and will include basic contribution and contact information.
* **Copy To Another Account:** If you manage multiple accounts, this will copy the entities, including their contact information, and add them to the account of your choice.
* **Excel: Basic Contact Information:** Provides a spreadsheet with entity contact information only.
* **Excel Donor Summary:** Provides donor-specific information.
* **Excel Detailed Fundraising Export:** Provides most of the donor information and additional fundraising details.
* **Excel: Detailed Fundraising Export by Household:** This is the same as above, but it will group records linked with the spouse relationship.
* **Set Communications:** Apply a communication to the records found in your results.
* **Set Flags:** Select a flag to apply to all the records in your results.
* **Set Followup Reminders:** Create a reminder to contact the entity on a later or specific date.
* **Set Pledges/Targets:** Create and set a Pledge or Target for the results of your search.
* **Start Drip Campaign:** Begin an email Drip Campaign with the entities in your search results, as well as allow AI to update the campaign for you.
* **View Records:** Opens the record’s details page, starting with the first result. You will have an option at the bottom left and right of the entity records to flip through the records displayed.
* **Save & Run Search:** Provides the ability to save the search criteria in case it is a report you will run frequently, as well as generate the results directly on the screen.

### Other Actions ###

Saved Searches is where you will find all of the searches that you have saved. This is also where you can manage them by removing or updating the name of a saved search.

Custom Exports allows you to update and create Custom Exports you would like to use to export only the details you want.

On the Scheduled Reports page, you are able to select your Saved Advanced Searches as a Report option. Note that this will only be a Scheduled Report option if you have a Custom Export already built.

### **Advanced Search Recipes**  ###

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to generate some of the more common searches:

If you use this alternative method to file and have a Signature ID & PIN, after uploading your report, you’ll need to log into your [NetFile User Account](https://netfile.com/Filer/Authentication/LogIn) and approve the report on the Pending Filings page before the filing is accepted.

If after filing directly from ISP or uploading via NetFile’s API you get a return email from NetFile with error messages and need help deciphering these error messages, please see [My Local Filing With NetFile Just Failed.

# WHAT IS EVENT MANAGEMENT

What Is Event Management?
==========

The Event management tool is designed to make it easy for you to track and manage your fundraising and other events.

Adding specific details to the event provides a bigger picture of its success.

To add details to an event, first navigate to the Events page under the Tools tab, then click the name of the event. On the resulting page you’ll see basic event details at the top and three sections below it: Flags, Communication Types, and Saved Advanced Searches.

This screen is essentially an Event’s dashboard page.

To edit the main event details, click the green triangle in the top right corner. In the window that appears you can update the Name, Date of the event, and the Event Type.

**Flags:** If you use Flags to help you identify the Event where transactions occurred, add the Flag to this section.

**Communication Types:** Any communications made for the Event can be added here.

**Saved Advanced Searches:** If you’ve created and saved Advanced Searches and they’re used to gather info on an Event, add that Saved Advanced Search here.

**Download Report:** After associating all the appropriate flags, communication types, and advanced searches with your event, click the Download Report button. This will give you a consolidate view of everyone associated with your event through any of these or because they had a transaction associated with the event.

# HOW DO I PREPARE MY TERMINATION REPORT

How Do I Prepare My Termination Report?
==========

If your campaign is ending, there are certain steps to take in the database in order to prepare for the final compliance report filing.

In the end, you’ll need to make sure your balances for anything outstanding is $0 in order to terminate the campaign. Some states have specific requirements so it may be wise to reach out to a state analyst to determine what is needed.

Once you have those specifics, in ISP you’ll work to lower any outstanding balances.

If your total loans outstanding is more than the total Cash on Hand, it’s usually a simple matter of adding loan repayments to the outstanding loans until you are at $0 Cash on Hand. You can do that by navigating to Accounting, then to Balances, then clicking on the hotdog menu next to any outstanding loans and selecting Add Repayment.

If the total outstanding is greater than Cash on Hand, you’ll have to use the Add Balance Reduction hotdog menu option to indicate the loan amount is forgiven. This is done similarly to adding a repayment but you will want to click in the Tags field on the Add Balance Reduction transaction and select Forgiven. Please be sure to also add a Compliance note explaining the transaction.

Once the Net Worth is at $0, you can file your Termination Report.

Once you have filed your Termination Report, you have the option to stop billing on your account or keeping your account open after the committee has been terminated by going to the [Account Management](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-use-the-account-management-page/) page.

==========

Applies To: Maine

After generating your report in ISP, click Download to retrieve your file. The downloaded efile is formatted as .xlsx. If you open the file with Excel, you will get a warning message at the top of the file. This is expected.

# HOW DO I SET FLAGS USING ADVANCED SEARCH AI

How Do I Set Flags Using Advanced Search & AI?
==========

Using Advanced Search, you can add a specific Flag en masse to the results of your search. You also have the option of using AI to automatically update records with the Flag when the records are added to the database and meet the criteria of the search.

How do I set a Flag to records on a one time basis?
----------

First and foremost, ensure the Flag already exists in your database under the Lists tab. If it does not, be sure to add it before moving forward. If it does or after you’ve created it, navigate to the Advanced Search screen.

In order to apply a Flag en masse, use Advanced Search to locate everyone in the database you’d like to apply this Flag to. Once you have generated that list, click the Exports & Actions button at the bottom of the screen and select Set Flags. In the window that opens, select the Flag you’d like to add, then the Add Flag option, then click Process.

How do I let AI set the Flag?
----------

If you do want AI to keep the record updated for you with the Flag, in the window that appears when Set Flag is selected, choose either Add Flags or Add & Delete Flags. Both options will let AI automatically add a Flag to any record that meets your search parameters.

The main difference between the Add Flags and the Add & Delete Flags options is that the second one will also remove Flags from records that no longer meet the search criteria. For example, if you are excluding records based on a contribution limit and a contribution is refunded that makes the contribution total less that the criteria you set, it will remove the Flag from the record.

For any new entity that matches the search criteria that are added in the next 24 hours, AI will automatically add that Flag to the record. This will allow those records to populate on saved or future searches containing that Flag.

You can also verify if AI is turned on to set Flags to new records by navigating to the Tools menu and selecting ai@ISP. In the middle of the page will be a new Managed Flags section. This section shows the Flags that AI is automatically adding/managing to new records that meet the criteria of the Advanced Search.

# HOW DOES THE 21 DAY LIMIT ON DEBTS BEFORE THEY BECOME LOANS IMPACT REPORTING

How Does the 21 Day Limit on Debts Before They Become Loans Impact Reporting?
==========

Applies To: Washington – Candidate Committees

In Washington, there is a 21 day limit to repay debts before they are considered loans. This will have an effect on how the transaction appears on the C4.

For example, if you have an Accrued Expense dated January 1st but the repayment isn’t made until February 1st, the debt became a loan after 21 days had past and is now considered a loan. The date it became a loan will then be shown on the report.

Please note, per the PDC, this in-kind loan only applies to candidates:

*“If a candidate makes documented out-of-pocket campaign expenditures on behalf of his or her campaign expecting repayment (not intending to make an in-kind contribution), the campaign committee must repay the candidate within 21 days of the expenditure or the candidate will be deemed to have made an in-kind loan to his or her campaign committee which is limited to $6,000 per election. Undocumented out-of-pocket campaign expenditures by the candidate are in-kind contributions not eligible for repayment.”*

# HOW DO I LOCATE DONORS OVER THE LIMIT

How Do I Locate Donors Over the Limit?
==========

There are a couple of different ways to locate donors that are potentially over the legal limit. The easiest option is to click on Reports and then Compliance Tools. On this page, there is a report called Check Transaction Limits. Using this report, you can select your chosen date range and easily view transactions that may be over the limit.

You can also use Advanced Search to find these donors. The specific rules would depend on your agency, but the following three-part search is typical.

Part 1: Limit to Individuals

----------

* Area: Entities
* Field: Entity Type
* Relationship: Is Any Of
* Value: Individual.

Click Add Rule.

Part 2: Limit to the Current Election

----------

* Area: Contributions (this includes monetary, inkind, and refunded contributions)
* Field: Election
* Relationship: Is Any Of
* Value: (select your current election)

Click Add Rule.

Part 3: Limit by Total Contributed

----------

* Area: Contributions
* Field: Total Value
* Relationship: Is More Than
* Value: (limit amount)

For example, if the limit on contributions from individuals is $2700.00, in the value field, you would enter $2700.

Click Add **Compound** Rule.

Adding as a compound rule is necessary to ensure that the amount is limited to only the election you selected in part 2.

Using your Search

----------

To generate the report, click the Run Search button at the bottom.

If you plan to run this specific search frequently, click Save & Run Search. This will allow you to give the search a notable name and save it as a Saved Search. To locate it later, click the Saved Search button and select the saved search from the menu that appears.

# HOW DO I FIND NON DONORS

How Do I Find Non-donors?
==========

Oftentimes a list is needed of Individuals in your database who have not donated to the campaign. This, for example, could be used for mailing purposes to contact potential donors. This list can be generated in a two step Advanced Search recipe.

The first step is to start with locating individuals:

* **Area:** Entities
* **Field:** Entity Type
* **Relationship:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** Individual

Click the Add Rule button. Next, back up in the Add Rule section, select the following:

* **Area:** Contributions
* **Field:** Value
* **Relationship:** Is More Than
* **Value:** 0

Instead of clicking Add Rule, click Add as Exclusion.

At this point you have the option of generating the list on your screen by clicking the Run Search button at the bottom of the screen. You can also generate this list to a spreadsheet by selecting one of the Export options.

If you plan on generating this list on a regular basis, click the Save & Run Search button to save the search criteria for future use. This will prevent having to re-add the criteria every time you need the list. Moving forward you’ll see the list in the Saved Searches menu based on the name you gave it.

# HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE FOR YOUR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

How to Choose the Best Accounting Software for Your Political Campaign
==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

Welcome to the complex and dynamic world of political campaigns! Behind the scenes, there's more than just passionate speeches and shaking hands. One crucial aspect that often goes unnoticed but plays a pivotal role in the success of any political endeavor is the use of accounting software. Let’s explore how to choose political campaign accounting software, exploring its role in streamlining financial processes, meeting unique financial requirements, ensuring compliance, and enabling effective budgeting and expense tracking.

The Significance of Accounting Software in Political Campaigns
----------

Political campaigns are multifaceted endeavors, requiring meticulous financial management. Political campaign accounting software emerges as a powerful ally, helping campaigns stay organized, efficient, and transparent. From managing contributions to tracking expenditures, these tools provide a comprehensive solution that ensures financial integrity throughout the campaign.

It is paramount to consider legal liability in campaign money management. Treasurers who don’t report accurately can be held legally liable and face fines or even prison time. Political opponents meticulously examine reports for anything suspicious and will not hesitate to call it to a reporter’s attention. Remember that anything in a report that looks shady will waste political capital. These kinds of mistakes have cost more than a few candidates their election night wins.

Streamlining Campaign Financial Processes
----------

In the fast-paced world of political campaigns, time is of the essence. Political campaign accounting software is the linchpin in streamlining financial processes, automating routine tasks, and reducing the risk of errors. This efficiency not only saves valuable time but also allows campaign teams to focus on strategy and connecting with voters.

Unique Financial Requirements of Political Campaigns
----------

Political campaigns operate under distinct financial dynamics, with the need to manage donations, navigate intricate fundraising regulations, and adapt to changing funding landscapes. Accounting software tailored to the unique requirements of political campaigns becomes indispensable in handling these complexities.

Compliance and Reporting Obligations
----------

Ensuring compliance with campaign finance regulations is paramount. Accounting software designed for political campaigns, such as the [ISPolitical](https://ispolitical.com/) suite, plays a crucial role in simplifying compliance tasks. From tracking contributions to generating accurate reports, these tools help campaigns adhere to legal requirements and maintain total transparency.

Budgeting and Expense Tracking
----------

Campaigns must meticulously manage their budgets to allocate resources effectively. Accounting software assists in creating realistic budgets, tracking expenses in real time, and providing insights to make informed financial decisions. This level of financial visibility is essential for the overall success of the campaign. It takes a very [specialized kind of accounting software](https://ispolitical.com/) to make space for the nuanced kinds of expenses associated with political campaigning.

Key Features to Look for in Accounting Software
----------

Choosing the right accounting software is crucial for a campaign's financial health. Treasurers and fundraisers alike have had to struggle with traditional accounting software and even sub-standard political accounting software in bygone days. Here are five key features to consider if only for the sake of those behind-the-scenes campaign heroes:

### [Political Software That Includes Compliance:](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/) ###

Compliance is crucial in political campaigning, fundraising, and accounting to uphold transparency, adhere to legal regulations, and maintain the trust of constituents. Explore tools that streamline compliance tasks, ensuring you run an ethical campaign that stays on the right side of the law (not to mention public opinion).

### [Political Software For Treasurers: ](https://ispolitical.com/treasurers/) ###

Political accounting software geared toward treasurers is crucial for effective financial oversight, streamlined reporting, and ensuring compliance with intricate campaign finance regulations, ultimately enabling treasurers to efficiently manage and safeguard a campaign's financial health. Look for features that simplify the treasurer's role.

### [Political Software Fundraising Capabilities:](https://ispolitical.com/fundraising/)  ###

Accounting software with built-in fundraising capabilities is essential for seamlessly managing contributions, tracking fundraising efforts, and ensuring compliance, providing a comprehensive solution to meet the unique financial needs of political campaigns.

### [Political Software Customer Support: ](https://ispolitical.com/support/) ###

Customer support in political accounting software is crucial for promptly addressing campaign-specific challenges, ensuring smooth operations, and providing treasurers and campaign teams with reliable assistance in navigating complex financial processes during critical moments. Prioritize software that comes with robust customer support, ensuring you have assistance when navigating any challenges.

### [Political Software Security:](https://ispolitical.com/security/)  ###

Security in political accounting software is paramount to safeguard sensitive financial data, protect against potential cyber threats, and maintain the trust of constituents, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of a campaign's financial information. Opt for accounting software that ensures this level of security.

Does Your Campaign Accounting Software Have All That?
----------

In the dynamic landscape of political campaigns, effective financial management is non-negotiable. Accounting software not only simplifies processes but also ensures compliance, transparency, and strategic decision-making. Hold your accounting software accountable…if your software doesn’t have all of these features built-in, you may need to ask yourself why and what you should do about it.

Campaigns can be messy. There are a lot of working parts and a lot to keep track of. As you embark on your campaign journey, learning how to choose accounting software can make all the difference in achieving your goals and keeping everything above board. Using political campaign accounting software that works for you and simplifies as much as possible is a win whether or not you win.

# HOW DO I CREATE AN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE

How Do I Create an Independent Expenditure?
==========

Creating an Independent Expenditure is similar to creating a typical Expense transaction, as well as using the tags in the Support/Oppose section.

1. Create an Expense transaction as you normally would through either the Register or from within the entity’s record.

2. Towards the bottom of the transaction, click the Specify Support/Oppose box to display more fields.

3. Complete the fields and in the Tag drop down, choose either IE to Support or IE to Oppose, depending on the transaction needs.

The FEC has very specific guidelines as to how these are reported for when transactions occur in different report periods. If you pay for an Independent Expenditure in one period, but the Support/Oppose Memo is dated for a report period in the future, we first report the expense on Line 21b. Then, when the Independent Expenditure happens, we have to shift the expense from Line 21B to Line 24 on Schedule E. This is done by creating a negative expense on Line 21B and a positive expense on Line 24 of Schedule E.

As for the CA 460, there are specific data entry steps necessary in order to accomplish specific results on the compliance report.

* If you want the compliance report to check the Independent Expenditure and Support boxes, use the IE to Support tag.
* If you want the compliance report to check the Independent Expenditure and Oppose boxes, use the IE to Oppose tag.

# HOW AND WHEN DO I USE BULK UPDATE

How and When Do I Use Bulk Update?
==========

If you need to update transactions en masse, you can use the Bulk Update option. This option is available in the Financial Reports area using the Transactions Report. If you are editing a recorded deposit, you’ll have the same options (i.e., once you have recorded your deposit, click the Related Pages button at the bottom of the page).

*Please note that changing transactions in bulk can significantly impact compliance reports. Use extreme caution with this tool, and be sure these are the changes you want to make.*

Once you have generated your report, click the Actions button at the bottom of the page. Select Bulk Update from this button’s drop-up menu. On the Bulk Update Transactions page, click the orange Update button. Make your selection from this button’s drop-up menu (i.e., what you want to change), which includes

* **Budget Category:** Choose which Budget Category you want the transactions list to have.

* **Date:** To change the date in bulk for your transactions, use the Update Date option.

* **Election:** Select the Election from the drop-down list of active elections in your database to update the transactions to have the same election designation.
* **Event:** Add or Update multiple transactions with the Update Event option to include or edit Events tied to the transactions found in your report.
* **Financial Account:** If you need to move multiple transactions from one Financial Account to another in your database, use this option.

* **Force Itemize:** Update transactions so they itemize on Compliance reports regardless of amount.
* **Notes:** In this window, you can select which note to update, whether it’s the Compliance Note, Check Note, or Internal Note. You can also update all the Note types at the same time.
* **Reporting Code:** This option lets you change the Reporting Code for all transactions in the results.
* **Transaction Method:** Use this to change the method the transaction was made.
* Remove Transaction Tags: If you have transactions with a Tag and would like to remove the tag, this option removes all Tags associated with the transactions in the list. Please note this option will not appear unless transactions exist in the database with Tags and fall within the report’s criteria.

In the Bulk Update window, make the change (i.e., what you want to change it to) and click the green Update button.

At the bottom of the Bulk Update page is a Delete Transactions option. This allows you to delete the transactions that show in the report results.

# WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORT

What Is the Financial Transaction Report?
==========

One of the many Financial reports you can generate is the Transactions report. This report allows you to view and export transactions in your database.

In the Search section are various fields and menus to narrow or broaden the results. To the right in the section header is a dropdown to add different search options. These include:

* **Transaction Type:** Choose one or more transaction types
* **Budget Category:** Choose one or more budget categories
* **Election:** Choose one or more elections
* **Financial Accounts:** Choose one or more financial accounts
* **Entity Types:** Choose one or more entity types
* **Events:** Choose one or more events
* **Amount Range:** Use a range of dates to narrow your search
* **Compliance Note Is/Contains:** Use this field to find results that is all of or contains the text in a compliance note
* **Internal Note Is/Contains:** Use this field to find results that is all of or contains the text in an internal note
* **Check Note Is/Contains:** Use this field to find results that is all of or contains the text in a check note
* **Advanced Searches:** Locate results from one of your saved Advanced Search templates
* **Creator:** Narrow your results by the creator of a transaction
* **Editor:** Narrow your results by the editor of a transaction

To the right of each option is a red X, which will simply remove them from view and place them in the Add dropdown.

If you are searching by Date, you can click the field name and choose from four different Date type options.

* **Transaction Date:** This is the date used for the transaction.
* **Whole Date:** This is the date of the transaction’s whole, if it is a non-deposit split.
* **Creation Date:** This is the date the transaction was created in your database. This can often be different than the date of the transaction.
* **Edit Date:** This is the date if the transaction was edited at any time.

Towards the bottom of the Search section are Split and Memo Handling options. These allow you to include or exclude Splits and Wholes, as well as Memos and Non-Memos.

Another search option is the Reported Handling trio of choices. Use these to filter results by whether they’re on a report marked as filed or not. Please note the option for Reported will only provide results that are itemized transactions and not included in any aggregates.

Use the Deposited filter to narrow your results down to whether or not transactions are in a deposit batch, not in a deposit batch, or both in a batch and outside of one.

After you’ve chosen the criteria for the report, you can then determine what specific columns of information you’d like to see, including sorting the data or aggregating transaction totals.

In the Display section is your option field for Columns. These are how your data will display on the screen, as well as export to a spreadsheet.

The Columns section contains all the ways to display the data, ranging from basic info like Amount and Date to more complex or in-depth data, such Allocation or Transaction Tags, if applicable.

It’s important to note that some Column options, such as All Emails and All Phones, take the system longer to sort through, which can cause the report generation time to be a little longer than usual.

There are three fields that, while similar, can affect your report totals in different ways:

* **Amount:** the raw amount of the transaction.
* **Net Worth Impact:** the transaction’s impact on the organization’s net worth.
* **Cash Impact:** the transaction’s impact on the organization’s cash.

These fields will have different numbers based on the nature of the transaction. For example, a $500 expense would have values of:

* Amount: $500
* Net Worth Impact: -$500
* Cash Impact: -$500

An In-Kind Contribution of $200 would have values of:

* Amount: $200
* Net Worth Impact: $0
* Cash Impact: $0

# HOW DO I SET UP AUTHENTICATION WITH ISP S API

How Do I Set Up Authentication with ISP’s API?
==========

**Please note this information is for software developers. If you are unsure about the following information, please contact your site developer.**

Getting Started

----------

In order to submit to ISP’s API, you need a username and password. If you have not integrated with ISP before, please contact us at [support@ispolitical.com](mailto:support@ispolitical.com) to get your integration setup and to obtain a token (also referred to as integration name) and password.

Basic Authentication

----------

ISP uses [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), slightly modified to support access to multiple accounts.

Your username will be a pipe delimited concatenation of the client account name and your integration login name. That means the format would be [Account]|[Integration] and is unique for each account data is being passed to. For example, the Civil War Online Donation System (CWODS), would use Washington|CWODS as the username to submit data to the specific account called Washington.

Together with the password, a base 64 authentication string should be posted to ISP’s API at https://app.ISPolitical.com/api/PublicForms/

Example
----------

If the integration is called CWODS, the account you are sending data to is Washington, and the password is ABC123, the submission would look like this:

Washington|CWODS:ABC123

Using base 64 encoding, that becomes V2FzaGluZ3RvbnxDV09EUzpBQkMxMjM=

If the same integration was also sending data to a different account at ISP, the base 64 encoded authorization string would be different. For example, if the second account name is Lincoln the submission would look like this:

Lincoln|CWODS:ABC123

Using base 64 encoding, that becomes TGluY29sbnxDV09EUzpBQkMxMjM=

Both examples above are from the same example integration, but the data would go into two different accounts.

# ABOUT THE NM SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT

About the NM Supplemental Report
==========

Applies To: New Mexico

Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is received after 5:00 p.m. on the Tuesday before the election shall be reported to the secretary of state either in a supplemental report on a prescribed form within twenty-four hours of receipt OR in the report to be filed no later than the Thursday before a primary, general or statewide special election, except that any such contribution or pledge to contribute that is received after 5:00 p.m. on the Friday before the election may be reported by 12:00 noon on the Monday before the election.

The Supplemental Report has two versions:

* **Non-Statewide:** Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is for more than $1,000 in a non-statewide election shall be reported to the secretary of state. This version is set at the $1000 limit for contributions for Non-Statewide Elections.
* **Statewide:** Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is more than $3,000 in a statewide election shall be reported to the secretary of state. This version is set at the $3000 limit for contributions for Statewide Elections.

When setting the dates, use the date of the Tuesday before the election as the Start Date.

To file your report, download the generated file and upload it by logging in to the [New Mexico Campaign Finance System](https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index).

After you’ve filed, be sure to mark filed reports as Filed to ensure transactions do not report twice.

Compliance notes for Monetary Contributions are just reported as Monetary Contribution by default but will pull from the Compliance Note field if any note exists.

# HOW DO I REPORT A TRANSFER RECEIVED FROM A JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE JFC

How Do I Report a Transfer Received From a Joint Fundraising Committee (JFC)?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees, Political Action Committees (PACs), Party Committees

Typically, when a committee receives a transfer from a Joint Fundraising Committee (JFC), the portion the filing committee receives will be less than the total of all the original contributions.

When this is entered into ISP, the total of splits will be greater than the whole amount. The FEC expects this.

In order to ensure the Transfer pulls to the FEC to Line 12, one of the two following conditions must be met:

* The whole (parent) entity must have a “relationship” with the filer committee
* The whole (parent) transaction must have the tag “Transfer”

You do not need to have both.

Exceptions
----------

When your transfer contains original contributions for a Recount election, you’ll need to remove/delete the splits from the main transfer transaction, and create a new transaction with the pro-rated amount as the whole amount.

Then, when making a deposit, ensure both the original and the Recount contributions are in the same deposit batch.

Can I run multiple transfers on the same date?
----------

You can have multiple transfers on the same date. The best way to handle this is to create the transfers individually, even if dates of transactions may overlap.

First, record the new contributions as usual in the JFC Management tool. Then make a JFC Transfer covering only the dates involving the new contributions. This will record a new JFC Transfer that might need slight editing if there are overlapping contributions. If there are no overlaps between contributions received, then you would just have a smaller second transfer.

# HOW DO I PULL EMPLOYER OCCUPATION LETTER SENT DATE FOR REPORTING

How Do I Pull “Employer/Occupation letter sent date” for Reporting?
==========

Applies To: Oregon

In Oregon, there is a reporting requirement to indicate a letter was sent requesting Employer and Occupation within 7 days of receiving the contribution. The way we account for this in ISP is to use a Communication in the individual’s record.

Add a Communication Type Occupation/Employer Request to the entity missing the Employer and/or Occupation information. Doing so will pull the following to the report for this entity: “Employer/Occupation letter sent {date of communication}.” If you update the Employer and/or Occupation after obtaining the required information, the system will not pull the requested info line.

AI@ISP can also do this automatically for you. In order to enable this feature, navigate to Tools, then ai@ISP, and enable Send Missing Occupation/Employer Emails. This will email reportable donors for you if they are missing their Occupation or Employer and ask them to reply with that information. ai@ISP will then add an appropriate communication to the record and the required note will pull to your compliance reports automatically. When the donor responds, ai@ISP will automatically update their record based on their response. Everyone on the ai@ISP recipient list will be forwarded a copy of any emails received and notified about what AI has done.

# HOW DO I CREATE THANK YOU LETTERS USING MICROSOFT WORD

How Do I Create Thank You Letters Using Microsoft Word?
==========

If you’ve exported your list of donors to thank to an Excel spreadsheet, you can use that to make donor Thank You letters in Microsoft Word via the Mail Merge feature.

First, make sure to confirm the data in the spreadsheet is prepared for the mail merge. For example, if you want to address the letter recipients by first name only, you’ll want to be sure the first and last names are separated into their own columns.

### Step 1: New Document ###

1. Click the Mailings tab, then Start Mail Merge.
2. In the group of options that appears, select Letters.
3. Next, click Select Recipients, then Use an Existing List.
4. You’ll then be prompted to select the Excel spreadsheet from the location you saved it to. If you are prompted to select from the table, choose “Sheet1$”.
5. Now click Edit Recipient List.
6. In the list of recipients, you can remove individuals by deselecting the box. You can also refine the recipient list using sorts, filters, and more.
7. Click the Ok button.

### Step 2: Insert Mail Merge Fields ###

The Mail Merge fields are for address information so the document knows who to address the letters to.

1. Still in the Mailings tab, click Address Block.
2. In the window that appears, select the name format you want for the letter. You can also preview the address on the right to ensure it is how you prefer it.
3. When you’ve selected your preferences, click OK

For safety sake, save the work you’ve done so far. Click File at the top, then Save, then name the document and save it to a location you’ll remember.

### Step 3: Letter Greeting ###

1. Click the Greeting Line option.
2. In the window, select your greeting preferences, as well as preview your choices.
3. Click OK when ready.
4. Click to save the file.

### Step 4: Insert Data from Excel Spreadsheet ###

1. Click Insert Merge Fields.
2. In the list that appears, select the name field, which will be the column name from the spreadsheet.
3. Repeat the process with other merge fields in the list, using only the fields you prefer.

You can now preview the letter prior to finishing by clicking the Preview Results option. You can also click through each letter by using the preview options to the right of the Preview Results button.

Finally, when ready, click the Finish & Merge button and select from one of the three options. You can either edit each individual document, print the document, or send it in an email message.

Once again, make sure you save the document after you finish the mail merge. This will allow you to re-use the document for future mail merges.

# WHAT IS ESIGNATURE AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is eSignature and How Do I Use It?
==========

Applies To: California

California allows you and others to electronically sign compliance reports. In conjunction with the Xodo Sign integration, you can use the eSignature process for CA compliance reports. This will allow you to electronically send the report to another person to sign the PDF copy before submitting it to the state.

If Xodo Sign has not been added as an integration in your database yet, navigate to the Integrations page first and [install Xodo Sign](http://install Xodo Signhttps://ispolitical.com/What-Is-the-Xodo-Sign-Integration-and-How-Do-I-Use-It/). You must have this integration installed in your database before using eSignature.

How do I send it to someone else for their signature?
----------

After Xodo Sign has been added to your database, generate the CA report. At the bottom of the screen, click the Filing button, and you’ll see an option for Send PDF for eSignature. Clicking that will open a window where you will add the Name and Email Address of those who need to sign it.

The individual will receive an email from ISP stating a Compliance report needs their signature. They will complete the eSignature process via Xodo Sign.

How do I know they signed it?
----------

After generating the report, you’ll see another button labeled Related Pages. In that menu is an option called eSignature Report Status. Click that, and you’ll be directed to the eSignature Reports page. The eSignature Reports Status page allows you to track the progress of any reports that require an electronic signature. These results happen in real time so the moment an eSignature has been added to the report, this page will update automatically.

On this screen, you’ll see several columns. The first two will be the Report Name and the Form/Version information. The next two will be status-related columns.

* **Forwarded To State:** This column will show either True or False. Once all signers have added their signatures to the report, it will be submitted to the state, and the status will show True. If no signers have signed it, it will display False.
* **Missing Signers:** If the status is False, this column will display who has not signed the report yet.

Note: Once the state receives digitally signed compliance reports, these documents are stored in its secure digital system. Digitally signed statements are the equivalent of the state’s paper forms, so they are managed in a similar manner. They will be logged and stored, and they can be pulled for official copy requests; however, they will not be displayed on Cal-Access.

# USING THE MARK AS FILED FEATURE

Using the Mark as Filed Feature
==========

The Mark As Filed feature is an important part of the filing process, most notably when filing amendments. When the report generates, you’ll see the button at the bottom of the screen.

In some states, Florida for example, marking the report as filed is critical. This is due to how the amendment is on a per-transaction basis. In other words, you don’t amend the report, you amend each and every transaction to determine if it was Added, Deleted, or Changed.

Furthermore, some states use information that we capture on the originally filed report as the base for amendments. This allows the reports to be “traced” so it’s clear which specific report is being amended.

We encourage everyone to mark the report as filed so any potential amendment filing runs smoother, as well as allowing Support staff to find the filed report easier.

If you receive notifications for reports you’ve already marked as filed or filed outside of ISP, regenerate the report using the correct dates and once it generates, click the Mark as Filed button. This will inform the system a notification is no longer needed.

Running a successful political campaign requires more than just a strong message and a dedicated team. It requires funding, and lots of it! Attracting political donors can be challenging, but with the right strategies and tools, you can effectively increase your campaign donors and secure the financial support you need. In this article, we’ll explore proven methods to find political donors and raise funds for your political campaign.

Understanding Who Funds Political Campaigns
----------

Before diving into strategies, it's crucial to understand who funds political campaigns. Political donors come from various backgrounds, including:

* **Individuals:** Everyday citizens who believe in your cause.
* **Businesses:** Companies that support your policies.
* **Political Action Committees (PACs):** Organizations that pool contributions to support or oppose candidates.
* **Interest Groups:** Groups focused on specific issues aligning with your campaign.

How to Find Campaign Donors
----------

Finding campaign donors requires a mix of research, networking, and outreach. Here are some effective ways to find political donors:

* **Leverage Your Network**

* Start with friends, family, and acquaintances. Personal connections are often the most willing to support your campaign.
* Attend local community events and political gatherings to meet potential donors.
* Your phone contacts and email client have more people in there than you would imagine. These are a great start.

* **Utilize Social Media**

* Use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to reach a broader audience. Share your campaign’s vision and updates regularly. Start with your existing network and build from there.
* Always use contrasting colors when posting images. Your first job is to stop their scroll.
* Ask questions on social media. The more comments, likes, and interactions you get, the more the algorithm will share your post.
* Reply to comments. Spark the algorithm but having a conversation with your supporters. The more times they comment, the more people will see your post.

* **Email Campaigns**

* Send personalized emails to potential donors. Use email marketing tools to segment your audience and tailor your messages accordingly.
* Highlight the impact of their donations and provide easy-to-use donation links like those provided by [Anedot](https://www.anedot.com/), [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/), [Winred](https://winred.com/), or [E-Fundrasing](https://www.efundraisingconnections.com/). \*Make sure to use a political credit card processor as the big, out of the box options rarely provide all the data your treasurer needs to keep you compliant.

* **Host Fundraising Events**

* Organize events like dinners, rallies, and auctions. These provide opportunities to connect with potential donors in person.
* Ensure these events are well-publicized and offer something of value to attendees.

* **Phone Banking**

* Reach out to potential donors through phone calls. Prepare a script that clearly communicates your campaign’s goals and the importance of their contribution.
* Fundraising software like [ISP](http://www.ispolitical.com) has tools to make sure you get the most from your calls. A smartly designed call campaign is the difference between striking out and striking gold!

How to Raise Funds for Your Political Campaign
----------

Raising funds effectively involves not just finding donors but also convincing them to contribute. Here’s how you can achieve this:

* **Clear and Compelling Messaging**

* Craft a compelling narrative that explains why your campaign matters. Use stories and data to make your case.
* Shorter is better. Donors are capricious and will immediately reject long appeals if faced with a wall of text or asked to watch a 2 minute video before the ask comes.
* Clearly outline how the funds will be used and the impact they will have.
* Be specific with each number. Research shows that detailing all numbers down to the one column will increase trust and the likelihood of donations.
* Don’t sell too much, too fast. It’s easier to get a second donation than the first. Ask for small, easy to give donations and then ask the same donor for more, later.
* Use your data to determine how much to ask the donor for. Then confidently ask for that much money. Do not be shy. Do not be scared.

* **Offer Multiple Donation Options**

* Make it as easy as possible to give money. An extra click online can reduce the number of donations by as much as 90%. The easier it is to give, the more money you will get.
* Provide various ways for donors to contribute, such as online payments, checks, or cash donations at events.
* Use a reliable political donation platform that ensures a seamless and secure transaction process. Do NOT use out of the box small business solutions like PayPal. They do not collect the right data for compliance and are not optimized for political donations.

* **Follow Up and Show Appreciation**

* Always thank your donors promptly. Personalize your thank-you messages to show genuine appreciation.
* Keep donors updated on your campaign’s progress and the impact of their contributions.

* **Utilize Good Accounting Software**

### What are the most effective ways to identify potential political donors? ###

Identifying potential political donors involves a combination of research and networking. Start by examining your existing connections—friends, family, colleagues, and community members. Use social media platforms to engage with supporters and expand your reach. Additionally, consider attending community events, and collaborating with local businesses and interest groups that align with your campaign's goals. You can buy donor data from various data brokers, but you should be careful and know what you’re doing. It’s not easy to make this profitable.

Accounting software like [ISPolitical](https://ispolitical.com/) can help manage donor information, track contributions, and provide insights into donor behavior. This ensures you maintain accurate records, understand donation patterns, and can effectively follow up with and thank your donors.

### What should I include in my fundraising emails to make them more effective? ###

To make your fundraising emails more effective, personalize them to address the recipient by name and acknowledge their previous support if applicable. Clearly explain your campaign's goals, how their donation will make a difference, and provide a compelling call-to-action. Including success stories, testimonials, and visual elements like images or videos can also enhance the email's impact. Avoid long emails, walls of text, a plethora of links and complicated or equivical asks.

### How can I ensure that my fundraising events are successful? ###

Successful fundraising events require careful planning and promotion. Choose a theme or format that resonates with your audience, and ensure the event offers value, whether through engaging speakers, entertainment, or networking opportunities. Promote the event through social media, email, and local media outlets. Additionally, follow up with attendees after the event to thank them and keep them engaged with your campaign.

### What legal considerations should I be aware of when raising funds for a political campaign? ###

When raising funds for a political campaign, it's important to adhere to all [legal regulations and reporting requirements](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/). This includes understanding contribution limits, ensuring proper documentation of all donations, and filing regular reports with the appropriate election authorities. Using accounting software like ISPolitical can help manage compliance by keeping accurate records and generating necessary reports.

# ABOUT THE CA FORM 498

About the CA Form 498
==========

Applies To: California

The CA Form 498 compliance report is used to report Late Payments Received that are $2,500 or more in aggregate to support (or oppose)
a single candidate (or committee) 90 days before an election.

If you are expecting a transaction to pull to this report, make sure there is a Support/Oppose Memo on the transaction. If there are multiple reports, they will generate in alphabetical order based on the S/O Memo.

How do I set up the Form 498 Report in ISPolitical?
----------

When generating a Form 498 in ISPolitical, navigate to the Reports tab, then Compliance. On the resulting criteria page, set up the following
required fields:

**Filer:** Make sure the correct person/entity is selected (if you have more than one).
**Compliance Report:** Select the CA Form 498 from the listed report types.
**Current Election:** The report will use the Current Election field to determine the 90-day report period for the Payments Rec’d.
**From/To Dates:** This sets the starting date and ending date for the Payments Rec’d.
**Entity:** This is an optional field. If you know the name of the Support/Oppose entity, you can begin typing the name to search and choose, and generate the
report for the specific entity. Leaving this field blank will randomly select the Support/Oppose Memo that applies.

How do I generate Form 498 reports for multiple candidates/committees?
----------

The Form 498 is unique in that a new report is needed for each entity with a Support/Oppose Memo over $2,500 in aggregate in
the period.

However, if you need to file more than one report, follow these steps to generate multiple Form 498 reports:

1. If you know the name of the Payment entity, you can search for that in the “Entity” drop down. If not, keep the drop down blank.
2. Review the data.
3. Make sure you file the report and then click Mark As Filed once you receive confirmation.
4. Click on regenerate. If you keep the drop down blank, the payee automatically selected in step 1 will be skipped, and the next one automatically selected.
5. Repeat until all payees have a Form 498 report (or the last report is empty).

# HOW DO I REPORT INKIND TRANSACTIONS PAID BY THE CANDIDATE

How Do I Report Inkind Transactions Paid by the Candidate?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When a candidate makes an In-kind transaction to a separate entity, correct data entry is important to ensure data pulls to the right locations on your compliance report.

In the Entity field when adding the transaction, use the candidate that made the In-kind transaction. Then, in the Splits section of the transaction, add the recipient of the In-kind transaction.

On the report, the transaction should appear on Line 11(d) as a receipt from the candidate AND on Line 17 as a disbursement to the vendor/recipient. These transactions will be marked as In-kind on the report.

# WHAT ARE THE PLEDGE OR TARGET METRICS REPORTS

What Are the Pledge or Target Metrics Reports?
==========

Both the Pledge Metrics and Target Metrics reports allow you to generate a list of all Pledges or Targets in your database. Pledges are donations that donors have agreed to make in the future, whereas Targets are set internally and are a fundraising goal.

Under the Reports tab, go to Fundraising/Analysis, then select either the Pledge Metrics report or the Target Metrics report from the dropdown menu. To help narrow down your results, you’ll have the following options to choose from:

* **Dates:** This required field determines the date range in which the Pledges or Targets have been created.
* **Compare To:** You can use these optional fields to compare any current Pledge or Target data with any past data you may have.
* **Owner(s):** If a Pledge or Target has been given an owner (i.e. a staff member who is responsible for tracking the transaction), you can narrow your search based on who owns the Pledge or Target.

When you have set your criteria, you have a few export options. You can Generate the results directly there on the screen, or you can choose to Print to PDF or export them to an Excel spreadsheet.

Here you can manage your Membership Types.

# HOW DO I CREATE A WINRED CONDUIT CHECK

How Do I Create a WinRed Conduit Check?
==========

Any transactions that are automatically sent via the WinRed integration will show in the Pending Imports section on your Dashboard. Import them directly into your Undeposited account and from there you’ll be able to create your WinRed conduit (earmark) check.

Note that the Record WinRed Conduit Check option will not appear unless you have the WinRed integration installed.

1. On the Deposit screen, you’ll see a list of transactions ready to be deposited. If any of the contributions are part of the WinRed conduit contributions, select those transactions, then click the Record WinRed Conduit Check button at the bottom of the screen.

2. In the window that appears, you’ll have the option of setting the Check Date, Check Amount, Election, and Budget Category.

3. Once you’ve added the applicable details, click the Add button.

4. This will direct you to the Edit Transaction screen where you’ll need to complete the main transaction details. You’ll notice, however, that most of the main details are filled in and the transactions you selected from the Deposit screen are showing as Splits.

5. After entering in all the details, choose either Save or Save & New at the bottom to finalize the WinRed conduit check.

When the transaction is saved, it will automatically populate the Transaction Tag field with Conduit – Conduit Check. This will NOT update the Tag field for Splits. That must be done separately.

# WHAT ARE AGGREGATES BY RELATIONSHIPS ON CA REPORT

What Are Aggregates by Relationships on CA Report?
==========

Applies To: California

California has special rules for aggregating between associated entities when it comes to compliance reports. For example, a donation from a single owner small business is aggregated with donations from the owner for the purpose of campaign limits.

As a result, ISP has the ability to account for donations that come from a business and the individual in our limit checking. Using relationships, the totals will aggregate and be subject to any thresholds determined by the state.

The following is a list of Relationships where this will come into play:

* Owner / Owner Of (Ind / Org)
* Parent Company / Subsidiary (Org / Org)
* Commonly Controlled / Commonly Controlled (Org / Org)

**Type of Report:** Type of Report is determined by the selection chosen on the report generation criteria screen in ISP. The system will automatically check the box on the report based on what you chose in the drop down menu.

# HOW DO I UPDATE OR EDIT A DEPOSIT

How Do I Update OR Edit a Deposit?
==========

In ISP, you can change details of an existing deposit or bulk update transactions in the deposit.

### Editing Deposits ###

If you need to edit a deposit, click the deposit from within the Register. This will bring you to the Record Deposit screen with the existing deposit’s details, including Name or Date, as well as adding or removing transactions from the deposit, if the details were incorrect.

If you’d like to add transactions to a deposit, locate the Add Transactions section below the list of highlighted transactions already existing in the deposit. For any transactions in the Add Transactions section that you’d like to add, check the box to the left of the transaction or transactions you want to add. To edit Number, Name, and/or Date, edit the fields at the top of the deposit.

When you have finished making changes to the deposit, click the Update Deposit button.

At the bottom of the screen is a Bulk Update button. Here you can make bulk updates to all the transactions in the deposit. This update can be for Budget Category, Transaction Method, or Notes. There is also a Delete Transactions button if you need to remove transactions.

The Add Deducted Fees menu allows you to create an expense to offset any fees associated with the deposit, or link an existing expense, refund, or reversed monetary contribution to the deposit.

# WA FORM C3 AND VOUCHER CONTRIBUTIONS

WA Form C3 and Voucher Contributions
==========

Applies To: Washington

[City of Seattle Voucher Program](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/EthicsElections/DemocracyVoucher/DVP_Candidate_Toolkit__Final.pdf) contributions are reported differently than standard monetary contributions. Because of this, the system handles them a little differently, as well.

Seattle is giving registered voters a voucher to spend on candidates of their choosing. Vouchers are received by either the committee and transmitted to the SEEC -or- sent to the SEEC directly designated for specific candidate(s). The Voucher Program team at the SEEC then sends an invoice to the City’s finance department that a check should be sent to the campaign. They also post the names and addresses of the voucher contributors for that particular invoice to the [eFiling web app](https://www2.ci.seattle.wa.us/ethics/filers/login.asp).

Next, the finance department, at some point after that, cuts the check and USPS mails it to the campaign. Vouchers are reported as contributions only after the campaign receives a check from the SEEC.

How do I add Vouchers to ISP so they report correctly on the C3?
----------

The first step is to log into your account on the SEEC website and download the .csv from the Voucher Data menu tab. After you’ve downloaded the spreadsheet, go back to ISP.

1. In the Tools tab select Quick Imports.
2. Select SEEC Voucher Data in the Format drop down menu. If you do not see this option, please contact Support.
3. Select options from the Budget Category, Election, and Financial Account as appropriate.
4. For Date, use the date of the parent transaction (which will not be reported) and/or the date of the Deposit, if you choose to deposit them directly to an account.
5. Below the data fields, click the Choose File button and select the .csv file you downloaded from the SEEC site.
6. Click Upload File.

When the file is uploaded, a new Monetary Contribution will be created in an Other Entity record called Voucher Program and will contain all of the individuals on the .csv as Splits. Each of those splits will automatically be assigned an amount of $25 and will also have a Voucher tag added to it. If you don’t already have the Other Entity record for Voucher Program, the upload will automatically create it for you

Please be aware the C3 will report the Splits as whole, as the Voucher Program requires all voucher transactions to be itemized regardless of aggregate. Furthermore, only voucher contributions should be in a deposit report. If not, a warning will be added.

Can I add the Voucher transactions without importing them?
----------

If you choose to not do the import, you can create an Other Entity record called Voucher Program and add a transaction in the total amount of vouchers. The Splits should then be the individual donors and must have the tag labeled Voucher.

# HOW DO I USE THE COLUMNS TO GATHER CONTACT INFO FOR THE FINANCIAL REPORT EXPORT

How Do I Use the Columns to Gather Contact Info for the Financial Report Export?
==========

When you generate your Transactions report, you may want to gather contact information of the results in order to send them a letter or contact them for another reason.

After you’ve created the report criteria, click in the Columns section. A list of all available Columns will appear for you to choose from. You can also type the name of the Column you’d like to add and the list will narrow itself down based on what you type.

A few of the columns require more significant data processing to create and therefore can slow down report generation. If you add one of these to the report, the system will display a warning.

When you are ready, click the Generate button to view results on the screen, or click the Print or Export button. If this will be a report you think you’ll be generating on a regular basis, click the Save Report button to save this criteria for future use.

# HOW DO I USE BCC EMAILS TO ADD COMMUNICATIONS

How Do I Use BCC Emails to Add Communications?
==========

When communicating via email, it’s helpful to note in the record of the email recipient that contact was made. Using the BCC Email feature, you can now add a Communication note to the record when the email is sent.

When sending the email, use the following in the Bcc address line:

[short account name]@bcc.ISPolitical.com

Your short account name is the name showing on the far left of the tab menu. It will be in All Caps.

For example, if your campaign is Abe Lincoln for President and your short account name is LINCOLN, the Bcc address you would use is LINCOLN@bcc.ISPolitical.com.

Please be sure the email recipients have a record in the database and the email info is in the record itself. Without this, ISP will not know which record to add the Communication note to.

# WHAT IS THE CA 46 REPORT HOW DO I PREPARE AND FILE IT

What Is the CA 460 Report & How Do I Prepare and File It?
==========

Applies To: California

The CA 460 report discloses all receipts and expenditures for your committee. After generating the report in ISP, you can either efile the report to the state or print off a copy to sign and paper file.

### What are the different versions? ###

On the criteria screen, you’ll see a drop down menu labeled Compliance Report Version. In this menu are various versions of the 460 you can generate.

**(Paper Only):** This version does not pull any signers to Section 4 – Verification on the efile or PDF

**$25 Report Itemization:** This version has a $25.00 Threshold instead of $100.00 for both Receipts & Expenses

**$50 Report Itemization:** This version has a $50.00 Threshold instead of $100.00 for both Receipts & Expenses

**CA Form 460 Standard:** This version has a $100.00 Threshold for both Receipts & Expenses

**Itemize All:** This version itemizes ALL transactions regardless of amount

**Itemize All Contributions:** This version itemizes ALL transactions regardless of amount on Schedules A/B/C

**Self-Employed Work Address:** This version pulls work address for self-employed individuals listed on Schedules A/B/C/H/I

**Static Aggregate:** This version calculates aggregate totals on a Static Basis (as of the end of the period) rather than Running Basis (as of the date of each transaction)

### What are some of the other options? ###

**Amended:** When Amending a report, be sure to select the previously filed report from the Amended Compliance Report drop down to ensure the correct Report Number (that appears on the first page of the originally filed report) is pulled. The Amendment Number is which amendment this report is. For example, if you have already filed 2 amendments, Amendment Number would be 3. When e-filing an amendment, the Original Report Number should be the original filing ID of the ORIGINAL report rather than the filing ID of the most recent amendment.

**Current Election:** An election date is required when Non-Election is selected. When this election type is selected, 01/01/1900 will appear on the report.

**Ending Investment Balance:** This is used in the Line 18 Cash Equivalents calculation, which includes investments that cannot be readily converted to cash. (NOTE: Most common amount is 0.) If you see a transaction with [info] in front of the amount, this indicates the Split transaction has no cash impact on the summary totals. The local agency will know what this refers to when they see it.

### Now that I have the criteria, what next? ###

When you have the criteria set, click the Generate button at the bottom of the screen. The system will provide progress notes at the top of the screen until it completes and you arrive on a screen showing a success message or any errors or warnings. If you’d like to review the PDF of the report prior to filing, click the Download PDF button at the bottom of the screen.

### Why are some pages blank? ###

If you’d like to review the PDF of the report prior to filing, click the Download PDF button at the bottom of the screen.

After you generate your CA 460, you may also notice some schedules included that have no info populating to them. This is expected. We include these blank pages on purpose, as some agencies require all schedules to ensure no schedules are missing.

With the blank schedule pages, the agency can confirm those schedules do not have any applicable transactions rather than those schedules were forgotten or intentionally excluded.

### Why are there no ECTD amounts for paid or forgiven loans? ###

If your report includes Loans that were paid or forgiven, you will not see an ECTD amount. This is by design, as there would no longer be any outstanding amount to report.

### What do I do if I’m satisfied with the results and ready to file? ###

Once reviewed, you can either use the eFiling option to submit the report or print it off and send it in. On the e-file screen you will provide your e-filing password.

### Why is my committee’s address showing up twice on the e-filing?
###

This is most likely because your address is set as both your reportable address and your mailing address. The reportable and mailing address get pulled separately onto the report, so if they’re the same, it’s expected to see it twice.

### How do I get the Treasurer and Principal Officer signatures to show on page 1? ###

Ensure you have the Treasurer and Principal Officer relationships set up on your filer record. The Principal Officer signature will only pull to page 1 if the committee is not a candidate committee.

# ABOUT THE FEC FORM 48 IE REPORT

About the FEC Form 48-IE Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC 48-IE is only filed by political committees. For Non-Committee filers, use the [Form 5](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-5-report/).

The FEC Independent Expenditures Report – Form 48-IE is used to report Independent Expenditures of more than $10,000. This will report Independent Expenditures made by the committee, and estimated expenses will pull to this report.

Please note Schedule E only discoloses Federal candidate or committee info.

If you need to file a report due to an Independent Expenditure over $1,000 within the 20 days before an election, please use the [FEC Form 24-IE Report](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-24-ie/).

There will be situations where the 48-IE and 24-IE reports overlap. Since the same information is reported on both, most use the 24-IE instead of the 48-IE during the 20 days before an election. Please confirm with your FEC analyst if you are not sure which report to use.

# WINRED INTEGRATION TROUBLESHOOTING

WinRed Integration Troubleshooting
==========

If you are experiencing issues with your WinRed integration, check below to see if your issue is mentioned and if so, how to fix it.

**I just set up my WinRed integration but no transactions are coming over to ISP.**

While there could be a few reasons for this, the most typical one is in the setup process on WinRed’s side. The account name in WinRed should be the “short name” used in ISP. This is the committee name in the top left corner of the ISP screen and is in all caps.

**I emailed WinRed and had them set up the integration with ISP, but no transactions are coming over to ISP.**

You may not have installed the integration in ISP. Navigate to Tools \> Add/Remove Tools, and locate the WinRed Integration. If you have any trouble setting up your integration, you can find more information [here](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-the-winred-integration/).

If you received some contributions through WinRed and they are not making their way over to ISP, email Support with an example transaction that should’ve came over.

**Still having problems?**

If you’re still having an issue that isn’t addressed by this help file, email Support with an example transaction that you’ve received via WinRed since fully setting up the integration. We can look at our Logs and diagnose the issue.

# WHAT ARE THE SORT ORDER OPTIONS FOR THE FEC REPORTS

What Are the Sort Order Options for the FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When generating the FEC Reports, you have the ability to set the Sort Order of data that pulls to the report.

Below are explanations for each option and what they allow you to do when sorting data on the report.

**Alphabetical:** With this sort option, transactions on the report will be sorted by entity name. If there are multiple transactions with the same name, they will then sort by date.

**Date:** This sort option allows for transactions to first be sorted by date, then alphabetically if the transactions have the same date.

**Alphabetical (splits with whole):** With Alphabetical (Split with Whole), the whole (parent/main) transaction follows the standard alphabetical sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same name, the splits further itemize by date order. If there is more than one split with the same name AND date, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Date (splits with whole):** With Date (Split with Whole), the whole (parent/main) transaction follows the standard date sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in date order. If there is more than one split with the same date, the splits further itemize by alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same date AND name, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Random:** This sort order option generates the transactions on the report in a random order, disregarding name and date information when determining placement.

# HOW DO I ADD DEPOSIT BATCHES VIA ISP S API

How Do I Add Deposit Batches via ISP’s API?
==========

ISPolitical supports submissions of online donations and other public forms via a rest API. If this is your first time with API submissions, please read up on the [authentication requirements and process](https://ispolitical.com/How-Do-I-Set-Up-Authentication-with-ISP-s-API/) in ISP.

ISP supports the creation of deposits based on payouts sent to clients.

Please be aware this help file is for adding a deposit batch via API. [Requestion deposit batch info via the API](https://ispolitical.com/Deposit-Batches-Request-API) is a separate process.

In order to utilize this, you need to include in the Transactions section of the JSON a “UniqueIdentifier” for each contribution and expense sent. Use the API sample submission below if you have deposit batches you’d like to submit via our API. If you have need for additional fields or questions, please contact ISPolitical staff.

Submitting Contributions in Batches
----------

Example of the added “UniqueIdentifier” line. Please see the [contribution help file](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-online-donations-via-isps-api/) for a full sample.

```
"Transactions":[
{
"Amount":"500",
"Date":"2020-01-07",
"TransactionType":"Monetary Contribution",
"UniqueIdentifier":"redleader-7divisionattack"
}
]
```

----------

----------

Submitting Fees

----------

Example of the added “UniqueIdentifier” line. Please see the [expense help file](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-fees-and-other-expenses-via-isps-api/) for a full sample.

```
"Transactions":[
{
"Amount":"62.23",
"Date":"2020-01-07",
"NoteForInternal":"Processing Fees",
"TransactionType":"Expense",
"UniqueIdentifier":"R2D2-urmyonlyhope7"
}
]

```

Submitting the Deposit Batch

----------

You can then send over a Deposit transaction containing the unique identifiers included on each contribution in the payout (as well as fees). The deposit info will then be used to create a batch deposit in ISP with all the transactions listed.

When using the example of a deposit submission below, note that Company *must* be Deposit and EntityType *must* be Other.

```
{
"Company":"Deposit",
"EntityType":"Other",
"Transactions":[
{
"Amount":"437.77",
"Date":"2020-01-07",
"TransactionType":"Deposit",
"Items":[
"R2D2-urmyonlyhope7",
"redleader-7divisionattack"

# WHAT ARE MONETARY CONTRIBUTION TRANSACTION TAGS

What Are Monetary Contribution Transaction Tags?
==========

Tags are used to provide Compliance reporting clarification. They provide information beyond the basic nature of the transaction that related to compliance reporting requirements. For Monetary Contributions, Tags are most frequently used in Conduit situations.

The following are Tags you will find when creating Monetary Contributions. However, because these are related to Compliance law, the Tags in your account will vary based on the jurisdiction you file with. Please confirm with your filing agency if you have any questions on which Tag is correct.

What are the different Tags for Monetary Contributions?
----------

When creating a Monetary Contribution, there will be five tags to choose from in the Tags drop-down menu:

* **Conduit – Conduit Check:** Use this if the transaction was a check or other transfer from a Conduit. Typically this is part of a larger batch of donations.
* **Conduit – Donor Check:** Use this if the transaction was a donation made directly to your committee but the physical check was passed through a Conduit.
* **Reattribution:** Use this if the transaction is split between two or more people, most commonly a couple and a portion of the donation needs to be reattributed to a spouse.
* **Redesignation:** Use this if all or part of a donation is moved to a different Election. With a Redesignation, check with your filing agency for any specific rules regarding the redesignation process.
* **Transfer:** Use this if the transaction is the transfer of funds to other authorized committees of the same candidate or sponsoring organization.

# HOW DO I SET UP AN ACTBLUE INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up an ActBlue Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

Setting up your ActBlue integration is a multi-step process, including contacting ActBlue via email.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from ActBlue via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, ActBlue will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

When transactions come over from ActBlue, we respect the timezone that ActBlue specifies. For example, if a transaction is sent to us on August 2nd from ActBlue at 1:00 am Eastern Time, even though for us that is August 1st at 10:00 pm Pacific, the system will treat that as an August 2nd transaction.

You can control how your ActBlue transactions come into ISP through the [ActBlue integration page](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-the-actblue-settings/).

You can also control your ActBlue transactions through the Auto-Import settings on the [ai@ISP page](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-ai-isp/).

### How do I add the ActBlue integration? ###

1. Go to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove Integrations.

2. On the resulting page, in the Available section, click the ActBlue integration.

3. A new window will appear and ask for your ActBlue Entity ID. This can be found by logging into your ActBlue account and viewing the URL of the Dashboard. It will be a 5 digit number and look something like this: [https://secure.actblue.com/entities/XXXXX/dashboard](https://secure.actblue.com/entities/XXXXX/dashboard)

4. After adding the ActBlue Entity ID, the next step is contacting ActBlue to complete the integration process. You’ll be sent an email from ISP with the exact information you need to send to ActBlue so they can complete the setup on their end.

After you send the email to ActBlue (support@actblue.com), ActBlue donations will appear in the [Pending Imports](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) section of the Dashboard within about 24 hours.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create an ActBlue organization record in the account with ActBlue’s details. We also suggest manually creating an ActBlue Technical Services organization record for any fees incurred from ActBlue.

In regards to the dates on these transactions, ActBlue sends the contribution data real-time as it is made. That is part of the process they have setup for integrations overall. While the conduit check itself can have the date received, the contributions would have the date given on them.

Please note temporary duplicate contact information is normal & expected with imports. They should get automatically cleaned up as part of the cleanup process. This typically runs within an hour of the import.

Applies To: California

If you are attempting to convert the .cal file into a PDF using the program downloaded off the California site, you will most likely encounter display issues. This program has rarely been updated in over 20 years and is still generating the 1999 PDF version of report. Because of this, we don’t recommend using their PDF converter.

If you need to view the PDF of the report, even though the filer may be a paper only filer, we recommend downloading the PDF version, too, after you generate the report in ISP.

Running a political campaign is a complex and demanding endeavor. Amidst the whirlwind of events, rallies, and policy planning, one critical aspect that often gets overlooked is financial management. This is where a professional campaign treasurer comes in. But what exactly are the duties of a campaign treasurer, and why is it essential to have a professional in this role? Let's dive into the key reasons and responsibilities associated with having a dedicated political campaign treasurer.

What Does a Campaign Treasurer Do?
----------

A campaign treasurer is responsible for the financial health and compliance of a political campaign. Here are the primary duties of a campaign treasurer:

* * **Financial Oversight:** The campaign treasurer manages all financial aspects of the campaign, including budgeting, tracking donations, and expenditures.
* **Compliance and Reporting:** Ensuring that the campaign adheres to all legal requirements and deadlines for financial reporting is critical for campaign success. This includes [filing regular reports](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/) with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), state, county, or even local regulatory bodies.

* **Regulatory Specialization:** A professonal political treasurer or compliance consultant will often specialize in FEC and several state regulatory bodies. A West Coast professional is likely to have experience filing in California ([FPPC](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/)), Oregon ([CLEAR](https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/campaign-finance.aspx)), Washington ([PDC](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/)), and Nevada ([NVSOS](https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSCandidateServices/AnonymousAccess/CEFDSearchUU/Search.aspx#individual_search)).

* **Contribution Management:** The political campaign treasurer handles the meticulous task of recording and reporting all contributions, ensuring they meet legal limits, are sourced appropriately, thanks donors, and provides financial reports to key committee stakeholders.
* **Expenditure Tracking:** They track all campaign spending, ensuring funds are used efficiently and in accordance with campaign finance laws.
* **Strategic Planning:** A professional treasurer assists in financial planning and forecasting, provides important financial reports, maintains budgets, and helps the campaign allocate resources effectively to maximize impact.

The Importance of a Professional Campaign Treasurer
----------

A campaign treasurer carries a significant burden on her/his shoulders by assuming legal responsibility for the committee’s compliance with applicable laws. If there is a sure fire component of a campaign that is constantly under strict surveillance and criticism, it is campaign finance. The treasurer, therefore, has the responsibility of conducting a flawless financial operation under the scrutiny of…well, the law and the world. So, what does a campaign treasurer do? Among their many responsibilities, the treasurer oversees:

1. **Ensuring Compliance:** Campaign finance laws are complex and constantly evolving. A professional political treasurer stays updated on these regulations, ensuring your campaign avoids costly fines, legal issues, and political capital loss.
2. **Financial Integrity:** Transparency and integrity in handling campaign funds are paramount. A seasoned campaign treasurer brings expertise and a level of professionalism that safeguards against financial mismanagement and fraud. The risk of embezzlement is higher in campaigns where friends and relatives fulfill accounting and compliance roles.
3. **Efficiency and Focus:** With a dedicated professional managing finances, the campaign team can focus on other critical areas like voter outreach and policy development. This specialization leads to more efficient campaign operations overall.
4. **Credibility and Trust:** Donors and supporters are more likely to trust a campaign that demonstrates financial responsibility and transparency. A professional campaign treasurer helps build this credibility, encouraging more substantial and sustained support.
5. **Strategic Advantage:** A skilled treasurer not only manages funds but also provides strategic financial insights, including where donors are most likely to be found and which messages are most likely to result in donations. This can be a significant advantage in planning and executing campaign strategies effectively.

FAQs
----------

### What qualifications should a campaign treasurer have? ###

A campaign treasurer should have a background in finance, accounting, or a related field. Experience with political campaigns and knowledge of pertinent campaign finance laws are crucial.

### Can a volunteer serve as a campaign treasurer? ###

While volunteers can serve as campaign treasurers, it is highly recommended to hire a professional with experience in campaign finance to ensure accuracy and compliance. If you choose to use a volunteer, give them the [tools ](http://www.ispolitical.com)they need to get the job done well.

### What are the consequences of not having a professional campaign treasurer? ###

Without a professional, your campaign risks financial mismanagement, non-compliance with legal requirements, potential fines, and loss of donor trust. You should also expect slower financial reporting and less transparency into your financial position. Expect less certainty when deciding to make major purchases.

### What is the difference between a campaign treasurer and a campaign manager? ###

A campaign treasurer focuses on the financial aspects and compliance of the campaign, while a campaign manager oversees the overall strategy, operations, and execution of the campaign plan. The campaign manager is technically in charge of the campaign, a professional treasurer will have the needed character to resist bad ideas and can protect you from amateurish mistakes.

### How often should a campaign treasurer report on the campaign’s financial status? ###

A campaign treasurer should provide regular updates, typically monthly, and ensure all required reports are filed according to the FEC’s schedule which can be found [here](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/dates-and-deadlines/). For state, county and local reporting, a professional treasurer will know when reports are due.

### What tools can a campaign treasurer use to manage finances effectively? ###

Campaign treasurers will use specialized [campaign finance software](https://ispolitical.com/treasurers/) designed to track contributions, expenses, and compliance requirements. Pros do not use spreadsheets or small business management accounting tools, as these tools do not work for political organizations. Some older, less sophisticated, slower professional treasurers attempt to hack Quickbooks and older formware political tools, but you should be weary of these charging by the hour for work they could automate and save your committee thousands of dollars.

ISPolitical has created a comprehensive campaign finance & accounting [tool](https://ispolitical.com/treasurers/) with treasurers in mind.

### How can a campaign treasurer contribute to strategic decision-making? ###

By providing detailed financial reports and forecasts, a campaign treasurer can offer insights on resource allocation, budgeting, and financial strategies that support the campaign’s goals.

### What should a campaign do if they face financial discrepancies? ###

Immediate action should be taken to identify and resolve discrepancies. A professional treasurer will conduct thorough audits, correct errors, and ensure transparent reporting to the correct regulatory agency.

Choosing the Right Campaign Treasurer
----------

When selecting a campaign treasurer, it’s important to consider their experience, knowledge of campaign finance law, and ability to handle the demands of the role. Look for individuals who have a proven track record in political campaign finance and a deep understanding of the legal landscape. ISP works with professional treasurers all day, every day.

# DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR FEC FORM 3X FILING

Different Options for FEC Form 3X Filing
==========

Sometimes there is confusion about the different filing schedules for different Form 3x filers. The options for filing have to do with the size and activity of the committee. Typically, a filer will declare if they will be a monthly or quarterly filer at the conception of the committee. If they decide to change how frequently they’re going to file, they will file a Form 99 using the Filing Frequency Change Notice report period. Form 3x filers can file in two ways:

* Monthly – this is usually party committees or PACs with a high volume of transactions.
* Quarterly – this is usually party committees or PACs that do not have a lot of transactions. Quarterly filers that have little to no activity can also opt to file semi-annually (mid-year and end-year).

Both monthly and quarterly filers need to file the Pre-General and Post-General reports, but monthly filers do not have to file the Pre-Primary reports.

# HOW DO I RECORD INKIND MADE TRANSACTIONS

How Do I Record Inkind Made Transactions?
==========

When recording in-kind contributions in ISPolitical, it’s a question of whether you’re paying money or giving a service or good (for which you cannot find a transaction) in support (or opposition) of another committee.

If someone pays for something for the committee as a gift to the committee, record that as an In-kind Contribution. The individual who paid for the gift is entered as the Entity (whole). If there is a transaction involved with vendor information (candidate paid for signs from ABC Printing) then click the Specify Splits button and fill out the vendor transaction details.

If your committee pays for something related to another committee’s fundraising event, record that contribution as an expense. Then click the Support/Oppose button at the bottom of the transaction and fill out the other committee’s details.

Below are examples of when and why to use an Expense with Support/Oppose options or a Non-Monetary Expense.

**Expense with Support/Oppose:** My committee will buy these yard sign stakes for your committee. My committee records this as an expense in support of your committee.

**Non-Monetary Expense:** My committee gives you these yard sign stakes. My committee records a non-monetary expense in support of your committee.

# HOW DO I RECORD PETTY CASH TRANSACTIONS

How Do I Record Petty Cash Transactions?

Petty Cash rules may vary with different filing agencies. If you are unsure, please contact your analyst or legal representative to record transactions accurately.

* Select your Petty Cash account as the To Account
* Select the appropriate account as the From Account, which is typically the account which you withdrew the cash from

### How do I record a petty cash disbursement? ###

* Under the Accounting tab, select Add Transaction, then choose Expense
* In the Entity field, use the individual vendor the petty cash was spent at
* Use Petty Cash as the account, if appropriate, to help keep track of available funds

This will impact your total Cash on Hand and depending on the amount and/or agency rules, could possibly itemize on reports.

# WHAT IS MULTI DIMENSIONAL BUDGETING HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Multi-Dimensional Budgeting & How Do I Use It?
==========

Multi-Dimensional Budgeting allows you to track Budget Categories in multiple ways. For example, a large organization has multiple physical branches that run semi-independently in different states. That organization could add a dimension for the different states the branches are in, which would allow them to track their transactions by both Budget Category and Dimension. In this instance, they could have transactions that are categorized as both Office Supplies and California.

If you haven’t yet, first install the Multi-Dimensional Budgeting tool by going to Add/Remove Tool under the Tools tab. Once this is done or if it already installed, you can access the Budget Dimensions page by clicking the blue Dimensions button at the bottom of the Budget Categories page. On this page you can add, edit, and delete Budget Dimensions.

Dimensions will also be an available field to search for in the Transactions report.

**Add Campaigns:** This option will add the Drip Campaign you select to records and run based on the criteria set previously.

**Add & Delete Campaigns:** This will add the campaign selected to the record that matches and delete any existing campaign on that record. In other words, it will replace anything already in place and start over if new criteria is matched.

# HOW DO I ADD A FORM 3Z TO THE FEC FORM 3 REPORT

How Do I Add a Form 3Z to the FEC Form 3 Report?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees

On the criteria page for your Compliance Report is an option for Form 3z. Any committees with relationships setup to the filer will be an option for including.

If you do not see the Form 3Z option, make sure you enter the appropriate date range. The Form 3Z will not populate if the appropriate date range is not entered. If you still do not see the Form 3Z, double check there is a committee linked to your filing committee’s record as an Affiliate in the Relationships section. If there is no Affiliate selected, take the following steps from within your committee’s record:

1. Click on the green triangle next to Relationships
2. Enter the name of the affiliated committee in the Affiliated field
3. Select the relationship Affiliated
4. Click Add Relationship

All Political Committees linked to the Filer Committee via Relationship will be available options for Form 3Z. By default, all committees will be excluded. If you click View/Edit on the report criteria page, a pop-up will appear that will allow you to click on any committees shown. You can then toggle between Including or Excluding them.

If you choose Include, you will then be able to enter the line totals to pull to the report. These fields are sticky fields, which means the numbers will remain until changed so you don’t have to do this each time you generate a report.

According to the FEC, the principal campaign committee must also file a consolidated report (FEC Form 3Z), which summarizes information included in its own report and those filed by other authorized committees.

Note that only authorized committees of the current campaign need to be included in the consolidated report.

These consolidated reports must include: the candidate’s activity, reports submitted to the principal campaign committee by any other authorized committees, and the principal campaign committee’s own activity.

Committee Type Info
----------

**Authorized Committee:** A designated committee that takes in contributions and make expenditures on behalf of the campaign.

**Leadership PAC:** A political committee that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding a federal office. The committee is not an authorized committee of the candidate or office holder, and is not affiliated with an authorized committee of a candidate or office holder. Members of Congress and other political leaders often establish these non-connected committees to support candidates for federal and non-federal offices.

# WHY ARE MY ACCRUED EXPENSES ITEMIZING INCORRECTLY ON THE WA C4

Why Are My Accrued Expenses Itemizing Incorrectly on the WA C4?
==========

Applies To: Washington

When filing a WA C4 Form, you may notice some accrued expenses will itemize despite being under the $750 itemization threshold.

The most likely reason for this is because there are multiple outstanding accrued expenses owed to that entity. On the WA C4, an accrued expense will itemize if the total outstanding balance owed to that entity meets the itemization threshold. In other words, an accrued expense will itemize if there is at least $750 that is already owed or would be owed to a single entity.

# HOW DO I FIND TRANSACTIONS ADDED ON A SPECIFIC DATE

How Do I Find Transactions Added on a Specific Date?
==========

If you’re looking for transactions that were added to your database on a certain date, you can use this recipe. Note that this will create a list of transactions that were *added to ISP* on a certain day, not necessarily transactions that were *donated* on that date.

Here is a recipe you can use to create this list of transactions:

If you plan on generating this list on a regular basis, click the Save & Run Search button to save the search criteria for future use. This will prevent having to re-add the criteria every time you need the list. Moving forward you’ll see the list in the Saved Searches menu based on the name you gave it.

# HOW DO I SET UP THE NUMERO INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up the Numero Integration?
==========

Numero is a credit card processing option that seamlessly integrates with ISP. Numero provides their clients with personalized onboarding to help them get set up and running one their integration with the compliance software is complete. This integration is for campaign fundraising and call time software for Democrats.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Numero via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Numero will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t do any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

How Do I Add the Numero Integration?
----------

1. Go to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove Integrations.

2. Search for Numero or you can scroll through the available integrations until you reach the Numero.

# WHAT ARE KEY STATISTICS

What Are Key Statistics?
==========

Key Statistics are important points of financial data that allow you to quickly view and ascertain transaction history, as well as provide insight into donation trends. These statistics can be found both on the Dashboard as entire database summaries and on an individual basis at the top of each entity record.

### Key Statistics: Dashboard ###

The Key Statistics section on the Dashboard gives you a broad sense of what is happening in your database. You’ll see statistics for record counts and monetary values, including total donations broken down by entity type.

Included in this section are donation summary totals for each active election you have in your database. This includes both how many donors have contributions towards that election and also the amount of donations with that election associated. You can also view a total dollar amount contributed to that election.

The Key Statistics section on the Dashboard is customizable. In the top right corner, click the option to set a date range of Key Statistics.

### Key Statistics: Entity Record ###

Key Statistics within records are customizable to allow you to view any or all of the statistics you prefer to see. In order to adjust what key statistics you see, click the wrench icon in the Key Stats section of any record.

There is a wide array of statistics to include in the Key Stats area of a record. Below are a few examples and descriptions. If you have any questions on any Key Stats not described below, please contact Support.

**Elections**: Besides calculations of statistics involving averages, many totals are based on the Elections in your database. When it comes to the Per-Election/Year checkboxes, these will only show if there are any applicable transactions for that combination of filer and election.

For example, if in the database there are four elections but one of them was a recent addition and no transactions have been tied to that election, only three of the elections and their totals will be displayed in the Key Stats area. The election with no transactions will not show up, even if the checkbox is checked, until a transaction has been added to the record with that election.

If transactions have been associated with a Non-Election, these will be calculated and displayed as yearly totals instead of election totals (i.e. Primary, General, etc.).

**Max to Limits**: The Max to Limits calculations will show you how much more a donor has left before they reach the threshold for that specific election. This will allow you an opportunity to ensure they don’t cross the donation limit when adding a new transaction while within the record.

**MIA**: These totals are based on the total previously given by a donor vs. the total for the current election or election cycle. However, if there are no donations to previous elections, the MIA totals will not appear. You can also find and export this data using Advanced Search (add link).

You also have the option of creating a Key Statistics Scheduled Report. This allows you to have a report sent automatically to any staff in your database based on a specific time range. Click here for more information on Scheduled Reports. (add link)

# HOW DO I ADD AND REPORT ACCRUED EXPENSE PAYMENTS ON THE C4

How Do I Add and Report Accrued Expense Payments on the C4?
==========

Applies To: Washington

On the WA Form C4 and the Form C4 Non-Candidate, payments towards an Accrued Expense with sub-debts, also called Splits, must be reported in a specific way.

When a partial payment is made on an Accrued Expense that has Splits, the payment is applied to the Split amounts on the report. These amounts are attributed to the splits using the first in, first out method. This means, if the Split dates are different, the oldest split will get the payment applied first. We are no longer itemizing Accrued Expense splits that are under $200 on Schedule B.

Downloading the PDF version also allows you to view the report in the future without having to regenerate it.

Once the report is generated, click the Download button at the bottom of the screen and select PDF. If this is not done upon generation, you will later need to regenerate the report to download the PDF. You can also select Save to File Later via the Filing button, which will allow you to save the report as a PDF as well.

# HOW DO I ADD OR SET A FILER

How Do I Add or Set a Filer?
==========

In order to generate Compliance reports, you’ll need to set your Filer. This allows the system to generate the reports with accurate committee and financial information. If you have not [set up your committee and staff records](https://ispolitical.com/what-records-are-needed-for-compliance-reporting/), you will need to do that before setting your filer. If you had ISPolitical import data from another system, some of this section may already be set up for you.

### How do I set my Filer?

###

Setting your Filer happens from the Compliance reports page.

1. Navigate to the Reports tab, then to Compliance.

2. Click on the Entity field, enter in your committee name, then click on it once you see it.

3. The Set button will appear in the bottom nav bar. Clicking this will set your Filer.

### Multiple Filers (and Joint Accounts)

###

Setting the Filer for joint accounts, or if you have multiple filers in one database, happens on the same page. Once you have one Filer set using the steps above….

1. Click the Related Pages menu button at the bottom of the screen, then click Manage Filers.

2. At the bottom of the resulting screen, click Add Filer.

3. In the window that appears, enter the committee name of the Filer you’d like to add, then click Add Filer.

Please note that your account may come with a set number of allowed filers in one database. If you have reached this max, you’ll see a message stating this and that adding a new filer may create additional charges.

# ABOUT THE FEC FORM 3P REPORT

About the FEC Form 3P Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 3P Report is required for all candidates running for the Office of President or Vice President to file reports of receipts and disbursements on this report. Any qualifying candidate having received contributions over $50,000 in aggregation, during a calendar year, is required to report that on the Form 3P.

During an election year, if a committee has received or anticipates receiving contributions in the aggregation of $100,000, or makes or anticipates expenditures of $100,000 or more, will file one or more of the following.

Reporting Periods:
----------

* **Monthly Report:** No later than the 20th day after the last day of the previous month.
* **12-Day Pre-Election:** Due no later than the 12th day before the general election in which the candidate seeks election and must include all of the transactions from the closing date of the last report through the 20th day before the election.
* **30-Day Post-General:** This report is due no later than 30 days after the general election and will include transactions from the closing date of the last report filed through the 20th day after the general.

The Year End with Column C report period is used by filers that ran in the primary but did not move forward with the general election. Using this reporting period will get Col C to reset the election cycle totals.

To get transactions to lines 20b and 25, ensure the transaction has the tag Fundraising. To get transactions to Lines 20c and 26, ensure the transaction has an Exempt Legal And Accounting tag. To get transactions to Line 29, make sure the transaction has the tag Other Disbursement.

# HOW DO I ADD CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING FEES

How Do I Add Conduit Transactions & Processing Fees?
==========

When you receive transactions via a Conduit (sometimes referred to as an Intermediary or Earmark), the processing fee is often removed from the check’s total amount.

For example, you receive a Conduit check for $990. However, the splits included two $500 contributions totaling $1000. This means the processor already removed a $10 processing fee.

### What is the data entry for a conduit check?
###

Using the example above, you would add a Monetary Contribution for $990, the exact amount you received, with the processor as the Entity. In the Splits area, add the two $500 contributions.

ISP is designed to automatically account for the $10 difference and while no actual expense transaction is created in the database, it will appear on the report as if one is there. This is for accounting purposes to ensure line totals add up correctly.

### Can I have one transaction in a conduit check? ###

Having one transaction in a batch deposit might seem redundant, but is good accounting practice for two reasons. The deposit date may differ from the check date, and the batch deposit can reflect refunds and expenses if you choose to record expenses separately.

### How do these appear on FEC compliance reports? ###

The Conduit Processing Fee transaction will appear on Line 17 if you are filing a Form 3 and on Line 21b (for both Party and Non-Party versions) if you are filing a Form 3X.

Please note that when it comes to conduit checks, they pull to reports based on the date the conduit check was received. This is in line with how joint fundraising contributions and other contributions with splits are typically reported.

# MY LOCAL FILING WITH NETFILE JUST FAILED NOW WHAT

My Local Filing With NetFile Just Failed. Now What?
==========

Applies To: California

Before you dig into any error messages, first check the basics. Be sure the following are correct in ISP.

**Filing ID:** Your filing ID will not be the same as our committee ID. Your filing ID will be in the format of capital letters, followed by a dash, followed by 6-8 numbers: ABC-123456

* The capital letters reference your local filing agency. Examples would be OCN for Oceanside or WESTSAC for West Sacramento.
* The dash (“-“) is sometimes referred to as an underscore (“\_”) in emails. However, it is a dash.

**Password:** Your filing password will be 6-10 characters long, and will be a combination of numbers and capital letters. You will not be able to change your filing password.

Once you’ve confirmed the information in your filer record is correct, the following are common responses and how to correct the issues identified.

1. Your e-filing with a period end date of [Report To Date], statement type of [Report Period Type], and election date of [Current Election Date] was rejected because no deadline with the end date matched your statement type.

* Check all of your settings. If, for example, you’re filing a Pre-Primary report, check that your Current Election is set to Primary and you’ve selected Pre-Election as the report period.
* Check the date associated with the Current Election by going to Lists, then to Elections, and ensuring the date is correct.
* Check the report from/to dates on the FPPC site.

2. The referenced Filer Id is not found: ABC-123456

* Double check your Filer ID based on the information mentioned above. Are you using a dash or an underscore? Have you transposed numbers? Are you using your Committee ID instead of your filing ID?

3. A value for field #4 ‘Content’ is required

* The State is moving towards requiring treasurer email addresses for the CA Form 410 & 460. NetFile is also moving in this direction. This warning means your filer or treasurer email address is missing. Add an email address to the Filer Committee record or the linked Filer Treasurer record & regenerate your report.

If you get a message from NetFile that isn’t on this list, please send that over to support@ispolitical.com so we can help you get filed.

# HOW DO I CREATE DRIP CAMPAIGNS DRIP EMAILS

How Do I Create Drip Campaigns & Drip Emails?
==========

Drip Campaigns are a great way to spread the word about events or other campaign communication. Within Drip Campaigns are Drip Emails, which are designed to send a series of emails staggered over a set period of time.

For example, if you have an upcoming fundraiser event, each day leading up to it you can send an email to interested constituents.

The first step is to establish a Drip Campaign.

How do I create a Drip Campaign?
----------

Navigate to the Drip Campaigns option under the Tools tab and on the resulting screen, click the [Add Drip Campaign button at the bottom](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-the-Add-Drip-Email-Options/). In the window that appears, add the Drip Email details and click the Add button.

Once added, you’ll see a blue [Add] link in the Emails column. Click this to open up another window in order to create an email for that Drip Campaign.

**Email Name:** This is the name of the email and different from the Subject line of the email. This allows you and staff to know what this email is for and about.

**Days into Campaign:** This lets you determine how many days into the Drip Campaign you’d like this email sent out.

For example, if it’s the first email of this particular Drip Campaign, you’d enter in 1. For the second email, you can choose how many days after that first email you’d like to send it, whether that’s 2 days into the campaign (1 day after the first email), 3 days into the campaign (2 days after the first email), and so on. For every Drip Email you have in the Drip Campaign, you can stagger them so they go out over a set period of time.

**Time of Day:** If you have a preference as to when people receive the email, use this field to choose that time.

Please note that the times chosen for Drip Email are Pacific time zone. Be sure to account for this when choosing the time for the emails to automatically be sent.

**Record As:** In ISP are many Communication Types. Use this to add a Communication to the recipients record when the email is sent.

**Subject:** This is the email subject line which recipients will see and know it’s from you.

**Body:** Create the text of your email here. You also have Merge Field options, which will automatically pull certain information, such as Name or other contact info, to the email when it is sent.

**Send As User:** With this box checked, the staff user that set the Drip Email option within the entity’s record will be shown as the sender. With it unchecked, the email will show the full campaign name (e.g. Washington for President).

**Reply To User:** With this box checked, the staff user that set the Drip Email option within the entity’s record will receive replies to the Drip Email. With it unchecked, the reply will go to the campaign’s standard email inbox instead of the staff member that set it in the entity’s record.

Once you’ve created your Drip Email, click the Add Drip Campaign Email button, or click Add & New to add that email and create a new Drip Email.

When emails are set to go out, the creator of the Drip Emails will receive a Pre-Drip email to inform of them of which emails are scheduled to be sent and who the recipients will be. This Pre-Drip email will be sent for each Drip Email created.

Using Advanced Search, you can also set up [automatic Drip Campaigns](https://ispolitical.com/How-to-Set-Up-Automated-Drip-Campaigns) run by our AI.

# HOW DO I VOID A RECORDED CHECK

How Do I Void A Recorded Check?
==========

It’s not uncommon for a committee to write a check in one reporting period only to find out the check was lost or never deposited in another. This can create a bit of confusion as to how it gets added to the system so it pulls to compliance and financial reports correctly.

1. Under the Accounting tab, select Add Transaction.

2. Select the Expense Transaction Type.

3. Make sure to check the Is Reversal checkbox at the top.

4. Create the Expense transaction with many of the same transaction details as the voided check. There are, however, a few notable differences.

* The date should match the date you voided the check. Any date in the period the check is voided should be ok. However, you may want to check with your agency to be sure.
* The compliance note should indicate this is a voided check and what prior check you are voiding.

5. Click Save to save the voided check transaction.

# ACTBLUE TRANSACTIONS AS THE INTERMEDIARY ON 497 REPORTS

ActBlue Transactions as the Intermediary on 497 Reports
==========

Applies To: California

When transactions are received via the [ActBlue integration](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-an-actblue-integration/) and need to be filed on the CA 497 24 Hour Report, the data entry must be correct in order for them to appear as they are required on the CA Form 497 report.

In the ActBlue transaction, locate the Tags menu and choose Conduit-Conduit Check.

Using this tag will pull the ActBlue transaction to the correct location on the 497 report and will also include an additional note that the transaction was received via a Conduit.

# HOW DO I USE THE ORGANIZATION SEARCH

How Do I Use the Organization Search?
==========

The Organization Search screen under the Add/Search tab allows you to locate any organization records in your database. You have the option of searching all Active records, all Inactive records, or All Records regardless of active/inactive status. These options are found directly above the blue Search button.

On the search screen are standard search criteria fields. These include Organization, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Notes. Other fields you can search on Organization Type, Business Type, Political Committee Type, and Flags.

For CA and FEC filers, you can have search results include committees directly from the agency’s site. Before searching, navigate to the Account Management page under the System tab and in the Account Preferences section, make sure the option for FEC and/or CA data in your search results says Include. Back on the Organization search screen, you’ll then see a checkbox option to Exclude those results. Note that if the box is unchecked, they will include the results by default. After your search, you will have the option of quickly adding that committee to your database.

When searching, you can use one field, a combination of fields, or all of them. Please note, however, that the more fields you use, the more narrow your search becomes.

If you don’t locate the organization you are looking for, you can click the Add Organization button at the bottom of the screen to add a new organization record to your database.

# WHAT ARE THE ADD DRIP EMAIL OPTIONS

What Are the Add Drip Email Options?
==========

When adding a Drip Email, you’ll be able to set the details of the Drip Email, as well as certain conditions for the email to adhere to.

In the window that appears after clicking Add Drip Email, add how many days after signup to send the email, what time of day to send the email, and the subject line of the email. These fields are required. Below that is where you create the body of the email and set other options, such as excluding firms.

The Limit Recipients section is where you can be specific about which users get which emails based on their role and actions already taken within the database.

Use the Last Logged In option for those that haven’t logged in in X amount of days. The Billing Rate Range allows you to send drip emails based on a billing range.

The remaining options in the window are more ways to limit who receives the Drip Emails. The three columns are:

* **Either:** The email will go to the recipient whether or not the option applies
* **Exclude:** The email will not go to anyone who has already engaged this option
* **Require:** The email will only go to those who have yet to engage this option

Select one of those three conditions for the following:

* **Has Logged In:** The account has been logged into at least once
* **Has Entities:** The account has a minimum of 5 Entities
* **Has Transactions:** The account has at least one transaction recorded
* **Has Taken Tour:** One or more users has completed the audio tour

# WHY ARE TRANSACTIONS NOT ITEMIZED ON FEC REPORTS

Why Are Transactions Not Itemized on FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When generating FEC reports, some transactions may not be showing up on your report as itemized entries. One of the more likely possibilities is that the transaction didn’t reach the FEC itemization threshold.

Per FEC guidelines, transactions must be itemized if it exceeds $200.00. Therefore, on ISP, a transaction at exactly $200.00 will not be itemized and will instead pull to the Unitemized line on the report (Line 11aii). Any transactions at $200.01 or above will still be itemized, however.

If the unitemized transaction is passed the threshold of $200.01 or if you still have a problem with transactions not itemizing, contact Support at [Support@ISPolitical.com](mailto:support@ispolitical.com) with the exact details.

# HOW DO I SET THE AI ALERT FOR OVER THE LIMIT CONTRIBUTIONS

How Do I Set the AI Alert for Over the Limit Contributions?
==========

One of the many useful AI features is receiving an alert when a contribution may be over the allowable threshold. This alert can be set on the ai@ISP page under the Tools tab.

If you do not already have AI turned on, toggle this feature to On. Then do the same for Send Alerts.

In the Alert Recipients option, click the Edit button to add yourself and/or other users in the database to receive the alerts. In the window that appears, type in your name or the name of another user, then click the green Edit Alert Recipients button.

With this feature turned on, AI will watch for any transactions over the limit and send an email for those that are. If you add or edit old transactions, AI will check those, too. Furthermore, AI will not automatically import transactions in the Pending Imports page that are over the limit but instead will alert you.

# WHERE DO I GET THE ORIGINAL CA FILING ID NUMBER

Where Do I Get the Original CA Filing ID Number?
==========

Applies To: California

When filing an amendment in ISP, the system will ask you for the Original Filing ID. The Original Filing ID, also known as the Report ID, can be found in the following three places:

1. When your report is accepted, there is a number indicated in the response. It’s usually called a Filing ID. If you go to Previously Generated Reports and look at your filed reports, you can find the Filing ID there.
2. You can also find the Filing ID in an email from Netfile after your report was successfully filed.
3. The final place the Filing ID can be found is by using the public portal for your jurisdiction, searching for your committee name, and locating the report.

# HOW DO I SET UP THE WINRED INTEGRATION

How Do I Set up the WinRed Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

WinRed integrates directly with ISP, allowing you to have the information from your WinRed account transfer directly into your ISP account.

1. Under the Integrations tab, select Add/Remove

2. Locate the WinRed integration in the Available section

3. Click the integration to install it

After you have completed the setup process on ISP’s side, head over to your WinRed account.

1. Log in to your WinRed account at portal.winred.com
2. Navigate to Utilities, then select the Integrations tab
3. Click ISP
4. Enter your Integration name, any notes, your ISP account name, and toggle the Integration Status to On. Click Save.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a WinRed organization record in the account with WinRed’s details.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from WinRed via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, WinRed will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

You can control how your transactions come into ISP through the Auto-Import settings on the [ai@ISP page](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-ai-isp/).

Linking a Donation Page

----------

With WinRed, you can also link a donation page for easy access from within ISP.

To link a donation page, navigate to the Integrations tab, click the WinRed option. Below the integration status is a Donation Page section. This allows you to link your WinRed donation page. Enter a Name for the Donation Page and the URL address. If you want to have multiple Donation Page options, you can add more than one.

Once the Donation Page has been added and your donation page linked, you’ll be able to add donations directly through ISP. This option will be found in two locations: Individual Search Results and Add Transaction.

In Individual Search Results, after a search is performed and the results appear, click the hot dog menu and select Enter Credit Card: WinRed Individual Record Details: When in the record, click the Add button at the bottom of the screen and select Enter Credit Card.

When the link opens, the entity’s basic contact info will auto-populate, and you’ll see fields to enter in donation information. The donation will be processed by Winred and come into ISP via the regular integration method.

# WHAT ARE WEBHOOKS AND HOW DO I USE THEM

What Are Webhooks and How Do I Use Them?
==========

Webhooks is an advanced Tools feature. Please only use webhooks if you are familiar with developing or have an experienced developer working with you.

Webhooks can be used to send information to another system. For example, a specialized email system or for updating a total raised ticker on your website.

With webhooks, whenever a donation is added to ISP, it and information about the donor will be automatically transmitted to your specified endpoint. Data that gets transmitted over contains both donation info and also basic donor contact info, such as addresses, phones, and emails.

All Monetary Contributions, regardless of how they were added to ISP, will be sent to the endpoint.

You also have the option of getting information sent to an endpoint whenever a contribution is edited or deleted.

You can have different endpoints for each one of these calls.

Data is sent via JSON and will be sent to your designated endpoint in near real time.

# NEW WASHINGTON FILING SYSTEM

New Washington Filing System
==========

Applies To: Washington

On March 1st, 2023, Washington rolled out its new filing system. This slightly altered the filing process. You still generate the report in ISP as usual, but now there are extra steps on the PDC’s website to certify the report. **The report will not be accepted until that certification process is complete on the PDC’s site.**

If you are filing to the state, select a PDC report in ISP. Once you have generated your report in ISP, select E-File Report to WA at the bottom. You will then be asked to input your E-Filing Token and email address. Once you have that information entered, select Submit Report to WA at the bottom.

Now you will be given a link to navigate to the PDC’s site. Log in to the PDC’s site, and then you will be given a chance to certify and submit the report. Once you certify, you will be given a confirmation number and have a chance to print the final version of the report.

For Seattle filers – Seattle is still using their old filing system. Seattle reports can be filed as before out of ISP. Make sure you select a Seattle report in ISP as opposed to a PDC report.

# WHY ISN T THE SPLIT OF MY ACCRUED EXPENSE PAYMENT SHOWING ON MY FEC REPORT

Why Isn’t the Split of My Accrued Expense Payment Showing on My FEC Report?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The splits of a standard Expense will pull to a report once the established itemization threshold has been met. The splits of an Accrued Expense Payment, on the other hand, will pull to a report ONLY when the first Accrued Expense Payment is made. This is due to FEC rules.

Additionally, because the FEC wants to see splits of Accrued Expenses when the first payment is made, the Accrued Expense Payment may appear on a report other than the report that contained the original Accrued Expense.

However, on the back end, all the Accrued Expenses and Accrued Expense Payment transactions are linked so the FEC can tell which splits belong to which payment.

Here’s an example:

During the final quarter of the year, there is an Accrued Expense to an individual where a vendor is the split.

During the first quarter of the following year, there is a payment to this Accrued Expense.

Since the FEC wants to see splits of Accrued Expenses when the first payment is made, the vendor will pull to the report during the first quarter of the following year, even though the Accrued Expense is from the previous year.

# WHAT ARE COMPLIANCE REPORTS

What Are Compliance Reports?
==========

When filing compliance reports, it’s good to have a basic understanding of what they are and why you would need to file a report. This will be the best first step into seeing what goes into the process as you prepare to file your report.

First and foremost, please be sure you familiarize yourself with your filing agency’s rules. While there are plenty of instances we can and will help, there will be times where we are unable to help. Knowing [when reports need to be filed](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-find-out-my-states-filing-dates/) based on certain activity, for example, will help prevent issues later on. Whether you’re a federal or state filer, we have help files for each state that will direct you to the agency’s site where you can find both rules and deadlines.

The report you file and when you file it will depend on several factors.

* **Agency:** The filing agency you are filing with is important. These can range from local to city to state to federal filing agencies.
* **Committee Type:** The report you file can vary depending on the type of committee. For example, candidate committees will file different reports than PACs.
* **Activity:** As mentioned in the Committee Type portion, different committee types will file different reports. This is because the type of activity that occurs within the committees, which will in turn trigger a specific report. For example, some agencies require a report if a large donation is received within a close timeframe leading up to an election. If you have AI turned on in your database, [AI will alert you of the report’s due date](https://ispolitical.com/Can-AI-Remind-ME-About-Report-Filings/) if a report is triggered based on specific activity like this.

There are also different types of compliance reports, typically falling into these categories.

* **Organizational:** If you are a new committee or an existing committee with a change to basic committee info, like an address, you would file a report that is more organizational in intent.
* **Periodic:** These reports are according to a set period of time and cover all transactions within that period. Periods can either be based on Elections or by calendar dates. These dates and filing calendars can be found on your agency’s website. You can subscribe to the [Calendar feed in ISP](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-calendar-feeds/) to track report due dates.

Based on agency limitations, ISP supports both types of reports. However, some filing agencies do not allow for reports to be filed through a third party vendor.

Managing political campaign finances with accuracy and transparency is crucial for success. At ISPolitical, our reports and dashboards on our political campaign finance reporting and accounting software provide comprehensive insights into every facet of campaign funding, helping to streamline your efforts and ensure compliance. Here’s a look at the key features and recent updates in our dashboard and reporting software, designed to give you a competitive edge.

Profit and Loss Reports
----------

A campaign would fail in a hurry if you didn’t know what your overall financial health looked like. Our software provides easy profit and loss statements and reports that make keeping track effortless. The Profit & Loss statement provides an in-depth view of your finances, helping you analyze income and expenses. You can choose between cash or accrual-based accounting, break down the report by months, and even schedule it for automatic delivery. This functionality simplifies financial planning and keeps your campaign on track.

Transaction Reporting
----------

Our powerful transaction reporting tool allows you to customize how you view financial transactions. Filter by dates, elections, notes, amount, entity types, and more. This flexibility enables you to generate lists with precisely the fields you need and you can save your preferences for future use! It’s a valuable tool for managing campaign finances efficiently.

Scheduled Reports

# WHAT ARE NOMINEE FUND TRANSFERS

What Are Nominee Fund Transfers?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

A PAC or Conduit that plans to gather contributions for a yet-to-be-determined candidate in opposition of another candidate is called a Nominee Fund. Once the recipient candidate has been determined, the funds are then transferred to that committee.

First create the Nominee Fund as an Organization record and mark it as a Political Committee. The type should be Political Action Committee (PAC). Then, in the Relationships section, add a Relationship type of Authorized Committee / Authorized Committee of. This Relationship designation is important for Compliance reporting purposes and will allow the transaction to pull to the correct line on the report, Line 12.

When you create the transaction, use the Nominee Fund record in the Entity field and in the Tag dropdown, select Nominee Fund Transfer.

Another important step to take is during the Compliance report generation process. On the report criteria screen is a checkbox labeled [Form 3Z](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-add-a-form-3z-to-the-fec-form-3-report/). Be sure to check this box when setting the criteria for your Compliance report. This will ensure the needed Form 3Z is generated along with your report.

# HOW DO I ADD ACTBLUE FEES

How Do I Add ActBlue Fees?
==========

Since ActBlue fees are not included as part of the import, you may need to add the fee expense transaction manually. You can do this one of two ways. For these two examples, we’ll say the total of the ActBlue contributions is $1,000 with a $50 fee.

### Option A
###

Reduce the main contribution amount by the fee total. For this example, since the main contribution amount is $1,000, you receive a check for $950 because of the Conduit (Earmark) Processing fee.

1. Add the ActBlue transaction for $950.
2. List the splits for the individual donors.

### Option B  ###

1. Add a contribution to ActBlue with splits. This can be done manually, through a Quick Import, or by using the Record ActBlue Conduit Check option on the Record Deposit screen.
2. Deposit the ActBlue transaction.
3. After the deposit has been created, click the Add Deducted Fees button at the bottom of the screen.
4. Select New Expense.
5. Add an expense to ActBlue Technical Services and include that in the deposit batch. Add an organization record for ActBlue Technical Services if necessary.

Option B is recommended because it’s more accurate to what actually happened. However, the most filing agencies don’t seem to mind if you use option A, and people like it because it’s less work.

# ABOUT THE FEC FORM 3 PAC REPORT

About the FEC Form 3 (PAC) Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 3 Political Action Committee is a disclosure report of Receipts and Disbursements for PACs.

* The 012 Splits Independent of Whole version itemizes splits with reporting code 012 on line 21 regardless of the whole parent reporting code.
* The 012 Splits with Whole version itemizes splits on line 21 if the whole transaction has reporting code 012.

Neither version is the right or wrong one, as this is a stylistic choice. The FEC has no preferred method.

Report Parameters
----------

* **Date Range:** Please ensure that your date range lines up with standard FEC reporting dates or dates that are specific to your report. Such as the Pre-Primary, Post-General, etc.
* **Current Election:** This dropdown contains all the elections set up for your campaign’s database.
* **Amended:** For filing amendments only, you will need to click this box, and additional fields will appear on which report is being amended. Only reports filed with ISP will show up; if you are amending a report filed outside ISP, you will need the original report number and start your amendment numbers going in order starting at 1.
* **Report Period:** Available report periods will appear in the dropdown.
* **Previously Unitemized Individual Donations:** This number needs to be correct or it could cause calculation errors on your report. You can click the Get From FEC to retrieve this information.
* **All Caps:** This will generate your entire report in all caps.
* **Sort Order:** Use this dropdown for a variety of ways in which you can have your report sorted by splits and wholes alphabetically, date, or at random.

If your previously filed report was a Post-General or Year End with Column C, use the amount found in Col C here instead. The Year End with Column C report period is used by filers that ran in the primary but did not move forward with the general election. This reporting period will get Column C to reset the election cycle totals.

# HOW DO I ADD AN ELECTION

How Do I Add an Election?
==========

Elections are an important part of any financial transaction, as well as Compliance and reporting. Without them, you’ll be unable to perform various important tasks, such as adding new transactions or setting up your Filer for compliance reports.

1. Navigate to Lists, then to Elections

2. At the bottom of the screen, click Add Election

3. Enter the Election Date and select an Election Type

When adding a new election, the Active Filer field is useful for when you have multiple filers in your database. This will add or exclude specific elections from certain monetary calculations, such as Room to Max values or other AI calculations. You can also use this feature if you’re supporting campaign in other primaries but not running in those elections.

If there is no election in any given calendar year, use Non-Election as the Election Type. Transactions using Non-Election will then aggregate based on the year as opposed to an election cycle.

### Accepting Voluntary Limits ###

If your candidate is in California and accepting the Voluntary Expenditure Limits, click the checkbox next to Accepting Voluntary Limits. This lets the system know this special case applies to reporting for the election you’re creating.

# HOW DO I FIND DONORS WHO GAVE TO THE PRIMARY BUT NOT THE GENERAL

How Do I Find Donors Who Gave to the Primary but Not the General?
==========

Donors are an important part of any campaign, especially within every election cycle. Finding those that donated to the Primary but not to the General is a useful step in raising more funds. Using Advanced Search, you can set specific search criteria that lets you find exactly what you’re looking for.

This report will happen in several steps using different rules and criteria. First start by locating those that donated to the Primary election.

* **Area:** Contributions
* **Field:** Election
* **Relationships:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** (select the Primary election, will start with a P)

Click the Add Rule button.

Next, back in the Add Rule section:

* **Area:** Contributions
* **Field:** Election
* **Relationships:** Is Any Of
* **Value:** (select the General election, will start with a G)

This time, click the Add as Exclusion button. This will remove any donors that have made a contribution during the General. Click Run Search to generate the report and see the results on screen. Again, this report will show all donors who contributed during the Primary but not the General.

What if the donor has reached the donation limit?
----------

Sometimes the reason why someone wouldn’t donate again during the General is that they’ve already maxed out. In that case, add the following Rule to exclude donors who have reached their limit:

* **Area:** Contributions
* **Field:** Amount
* **Relationship:** Is Less Than
* **Value:** (add contribution limit, no $ sign needed)

Click Add Rule and your search will only include donors who haven’t maxed out.

If you’re planning on running this specific search regularly, click Save & Run Search to save the criteria for future report generation.

# HOW DO I ADD A SUPPORT OPPOSE MEMO

How Do I Add a Support/Oppose Memo?
==========

Support/Oppose memos can be an important part of not just the transaction but also compliance reports. The correct data entry will prevent issues later on.

If you spend money to support or oppose a candidate or a measure, you need to record a Support/Oppose Memo within that transaction. S/O Memos nearly always should have the same date as the Expense they’re associated with.

1. Navigate to Accounting, then to Add Transaction
2. Select any type of Expense from the dropdown and complete the necessary fields
3. Scroll down and click the Specify Support/Oppose option
4. In the Entity field, type in the name of candidate (not the committee) or measure you are supporting or opposing
5. Complete the rest of the fields with the necessary information, including any [Tags](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-expense-transaction-tags-and-how-do-i-use-them/), if needed

If you are paying a vendor on behalf of another political committee, the same concept and steps apply.

CA Filers: S/O Memos are not required for payments to Slate Mailers.

2. **Log in to ORESTAR and Upload your file.**

a. To log into ORESTAR go to [www.oregonvotes.gov](http://www.oregonvotes.gov/), and click on **Log in** under the ORESTAR logo.

e. From the *Active Committee/Filers* page of **Private Workshop**, the user sees the active filers that the user can access. The campaign finance portion of ORESTAR is accessed by clicking the **Campaign Finance**button to the right of the filer name on the *Active Filers* page.

k. The uploaded file is validated to ensure it meets the XML file format specifications. An error message “Invalid XML File” will appear if the file was not uploaded because it did not comply with the format specifications.  **Contact ISPolitical support for assistance if this happens.**

a. To file a report, go to the **Transactions** tab.

b. To file the transactions from the *Transaction Queue* page, check the box to the left of the transaction ID #. To select all transactions in the queue, check the box in the column heading to the left of **ID#**.

Note: if clicking the **File/Due** button, a Transaction Filing Report will be generated and emailed *after* ORESTAR automatically files the transaction on its due date.

# HOW DO I CREATE AND REPORT ACCRUED EXPENSES WITHOUT THE INVOICE

How Do I Create and Report Accrued Expenses Without the Invoice?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Sometimes, before an invoice is even received, we are expecting an expense. Entering in this Accrued Expense and how it is reported comes with some guidelines by the FEC.

*“A written contract (including a media contract), promise, or agreement to make an expenditure which has not been paid for by the committee is an expenditure as of the date the contract, promise or obligation is made and is subject to the reporting requirements. Accounts payable and written contracts, promises, or agreements to make expenditures, in amounts of $500 or less, need not be disclosed until outstanding for sixty days or more. Note that special reporting rules apply when an individual makes an advance of personal funds for a good or service but expects to be reimbursed.”*

In short, the date of the Accrued Expense applies to the date the contract or obligation was made, regardless of the invoice. However, if the Accrued Expense is under $500, it does not need to be disclosed until outstanding for 60 days or more.

# WHAT IS JFC MANAGEMENT

What Is JFC Management?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The JFC Management page is broken into three different pages: Participants, Contributions, and Transfers. When you select the option from the Accounting tab, you’ll first land on the JFC Contributions page. However, if you haven’t set up Participants first, the system will direct you to this page first, as this is needed before you can add Contributions.

Typically, the process is setting up allocation rules (Participants), then the allocation of your contributions (Contributions), then the transfer funds step (Transfers). Once you add Participants, usually steps two and three are the most common steps taken moving forward, unless a new Participant is needed. To do this click the Manage JFC Participants button at the bottom of the screen.

Participants
----------

Prior to using the JFC Wizard, you must make sure all JFC participants have an entity record in your database. You may have to create separate entities for different funds of one organization. An example of two different funds would be General Fund vs Legal Fund. If your database contains multiple filers, those filers can also be created as a JFC Participant.

On the JFC Participants page, you’ll set the allocated amounts as found in your joint fundraising agreement.

First, click the Add Joint Fundraising Participant button at the bottom of the screen.

In the window that appears are Limit By options: Amount, Percentage, or Both. This limits this particular JFC to one or both and will determine the fields you see in the window.

**Participant:** Search here for the JFC entity record.

**Priority:** This is the order in which contributions will be allocated.

**Amount:** The maximum amount a contribution made by an Individual or Federal Non-Multicandidate Political Committee can donate.

**Multi-Candidate Amount:** The maximum amount a Federal Multicandidate Political Committee can donate.

**Percentage:** Percentage to be allocated.

Once you’ve added the needed details, click Add Joint Fundraising Participant, or Add & New to add the one you just added details for and create a new JFC.

If the Joint Fundraising Participant also has an ISP account, it can be linked to the Entity showing in the Participants list. You’ll then be able to automatically transfer data and transactions between accounts, including Budget Category, Election, and Financial Account.

Contributions
----------

First and foremost, please be sure the financial account(s) accepting contributions are marked as For JFC. To do this, go to your Financial Accounts under the Lists tab, click on the name of the appropriate account, then check the For JFC box and update the financial account.

On the JFC Contributions page are all the contributions that have been deposited but not allocated. Ensure all contributions for allocations have been deposited into a financial account that is marked as For JFC. Their amounts will automatically be distributed among the JFC participants according to the rules you previously set up.

If you need to update the amounts, click on any amount and type in the new amount. Clicking outside of the amount text field will save that change. One example of a reason to update is you know the donor is at max limit for one of the participants. Please note, however, that if you make any changes to the structure of the allocation, such as Order or formula changes, the Recalculate button will then follow those rules if you click it again.

You can also download a list of the transactions by clicking Download Draft at the bottom of the page. You’ll receive an Excel spreadsheet of the allocation distributions for others to review.

Once you have confirmed all contributions are at their proper allocation amount, click on Record & Export. After you click the Record & Export button, you will not see these contributions on this screen again.

Transfers
----------

On the JFC Transfers page, you can calculate and create the transfers.

First, enter in the Reserve amount, if any, then click the Calculate button at the bottom of the screen. You’ll receive a list of totals and items. For example, the list of Expenses are any expenses to entities other than the JFC participants. They are allocated to each Participant as per the ratio of contributions. The Advance of Funds items are Monetary Contributions received from any of the JFC Participants.

Note that the JFC Participant description is saved in the Internal Note field of the JFC transfer transaction. That is then used to do the linking for these calculations, so editing the Internal Notes will affect these calculations.

In the Transfer Amounts line item, adjust the recommended transfer amounts as you see fit by clicking in the Transfer Amounts cells and updating the amounts.

Once you have confirmed all transfers are at their proper allocation amount, click the Add Transfers as Expenses at the bottom of the screen to add expenses to the JFC participants.

It’s important to note that transfers are inherently not directly tied to contributions. It is common to not have transfers that exactly match the amounts of contributions. That said, the allocations still need to be reported, so splits are added based on dates. Specifically, any JFC allocation to that entity where:

* The JFC Allocation’s date is after the most recent transfer to the same entity
* The JFC Allocation’s date is on our before the day of the transfer

# HOW DO I SET UP AND USE THE NETFILE INTEGRATION

How Do I Set Up and Use the NetFile Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

While many treasurers have switched from NetFile to ISPolitical for their filing and compliance needs, we do still offer it as an integration option for those who want to continue its use. Please contact Support to have them add the integration to your database.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a NetFile organization record in the account with NetFile’s details.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. Agencies that use NetFile to receive compliance reports are not involved in any way with this integration and its process.
2. Only Monetary Contributions and In-Kind Contributions will be integrated over from NetFile.
3. Unlike other integrations found in ISP, all NetFile integrated transactions will be directly imported into the database instead of first appearing in the Pending Import queue to be manually imported in.

# MY FEC REPORT FAILED WHILE PROCESSING NOW WHAT

My FEC Report Failed While Processing. Now What?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

Every once in a while the FEC will give you a filing acknowledgement that says this:

**DISCLOSE — FEC Financial Disclosure Filing Acknowledgement**

\*\*\* ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! \*\*\*
Your filing was received but failed during processing. You may be required to re-file.
Please contact the electronic filing office for further instructions:
Phone: 202-694-1642, menu options 2, 4 or 5

This message is the FEC’s way of saying something may have gone wrong, but they don’t know what.

Here is what to do if you see this message from the FEC:

1) Check the FEC website to see if the file posted successfully, regardless of the error. If so, you don’t need to do anything!

2) If you don’t see your report on the FEC’s site, regenerate and attempt to refile the report as an original. There is a possibility the file will be rejected due to being a “duplicate” report.

3) Contact your analyst immediately, even if it is after hours. If you have a way to forward the acknowledgment to your analyst, that would be ideal, so that you have proof of an attempt of timely filing should the FEC inquire further.

According to FEC rules, Splits on the original Accrued Expense only pull when the first Accrued Expense Payment is made.

Group 3: Fees to Conduits

* Transaction Types: Monetary Contributions
* Transaction Tag: Conduit – Conduit Check

Note: ISP automatically calculates processing fees based on the difference between the splits and the main monetary contribution from the conduit.

**Line 18: Transfers to Other Authorized Committees**

Group 1: Expenses to Related Committee

* Transaction Types: Expenses
* Entities: Political Committees with a relationship with the Filer

Group 2: Reattribution/Redesignation Expenses to Affiliated

* Transaction Types: Expenses
* Has Dependent with Tag: Reattribution or Redesignation
* Entities: Political Committees with a relationship with the Filer

Note: Group 2 will be reported as memos.

Note: When the reattribution/redesignation happens across
reporting periods, the original transaction gets re-reported as a memo.
That’s why you’ll see the original transaction on the report with a memo
that says Original Contribution as Previously Reported.

**Line 19a: Loan Repayments, Individuals/Persons Other than Political Committees**

* Transaction Types: Loan Received Repayments
* Entities: The Candidate

**Line 19b: Loan Repayments, Of All Other Loans**

* Transaction Types: Loan Received Repayments
* Entities: All entities besides the Candidate

**Line 20a: Refunds of Contributions to Individuals/Persons other than Political Committees**

* Entities: All entities besides Political Committees or the Candidate

**Line 20b: Refunds of Contributions to Political Party Committees**

* Transaction Types: Refunded Contributions, Inkind Contributions (Reversal)
* Entities: Political Party Committees

**Line 20c: Refunds of Contributions to Other Political Committees (such as PACs)**

* Transaction Types: Refunded Contributions, Inkind Contributions (Reversal)
* Entities: All Political Committees except Party Committees

**Line 21: Other Disbursements**

# HOW DO I LINK SPOUSES

How Do I Link Spouses?
==========

The Link Spouses page allows you to connect two individual records as spouses into a household. This will be useful for any mail correspondences, as you’ll be able to send a single communication to two individuals at the same address.

First, you can determine your list of potential spouses by choosing the criteria the system uses to locate them. At the bottom of the screen you’ll have a button with two search criteria: Name and Address and Address Only.

You also have an option to Link All records as spouses, if you have confirmed they should all be linked.

If you’d like to link only one couple at a time, you’ll have a blue Link button to the right of each listing. When you click this button, you’ll receive a message stating the records have been linked.

# NAVIGATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATIONS WITH SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS

Navigating Campaign Finance Regulations with Software Solutions
==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

Campaign finance regulations play a pivotal role in maintaining transparency and fairness in the political landscape. As political campaigns evolve, so do the challenges associated with staying compliant with complex regulatory frameworks. In this article, we will explore the importance of campaign finance compliance, dive into the intricacies of federal and state regulations, and showcase the role of cutting-edge software solutions in streamlining the compliance process.

### **Campaign Finance Regulations** ###

Campaign finance regulations are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in political funding. They vary at federal, state, and local levels, encompassing rules related to fundraising, spending, and reporting.

### **The Importance of Political Campaign Compliance**  ###

Staying compliant is not just a legal obligation; it is crucial for maintaining public trust and credibility. Failure to adhere to campaign finance regulations can result in penalties and serious legal consequences. Those consequences can include fines and imprisonment, which not only damage a budget but wreak havoc on a candidate's reputation. The biggest fine imposed by the FEC was $940K! That’s a big price tag for nothing but bad press. Best to always keep it on the up and up by using [outstanding financial compliance software](https://ispolitical.com/treasurers/).

### **Software Solutions for Navigating Campaign Finance Regulations** ###

To address the challenges posed by intricate regulations, innovative software solutions have emerged. These tools not only facilitate compliance but also streamline reporting processes, provide timely alerts, and offer robust support systems. Because so much of compliance and campaigning have to do with finances, it makes sense to have the regulations and guidelines built-in to any good [political accounting software](https://ispolitical.com/).

### **Understanding Campaign Finance Regulations** ###

### Federal and State Regulations ###

Navigating campaign finance regulations requires a deep understanding of both federal and state-level rules. Each jurisdiction has its own set of requirements, making compliance a multifaceted task.

### Key Compliance Requirements for Political Campaigns ###

Campaign teams often grapple with challenges in understanding and staying up-to-date with evolving regulations. Nonetheless, political campaigns must adhere to the primary compliance requirements, at both federal and state levels, such as:

* **Contribution Limits:**

* Limits on the amount of money individuals, organizations, or other entities can contribute to a campaign.

* * * Different limits may apply to [contribution](https://ispolitical.com/fundraising/)s for primary and general elections.

* **Disclosure of Donors:**

* * * Requirements to disclose the identities of individuals or entities making contributions to the campaign. Disclosure often depends on the sum total of a donor’s contributions.
* Reporting deadlines for disclosing these contributions.

* **Record-Keeping:**

* * * Obligations to maintain detailed records of all financial transactions, including contributions received and expenditures made.
* Record-keeping requirements help ensure transparency and facilitate audits if necessary.

* **Expenditure Reporting:**

* * * Reporting obligations for all campaign expenditures, including payroll, advertising, campaign events, and other related costs.
* Detailed reporting on how campaign funds are spent.

* **Public Financing Rules:**

* * * If a campaign is participating in a public financing program, compliance with the rules and regulations governing such programs is crucial.

* **Anti-Coordination Rules:**

* * * Regulations preventing coordination between political campaigns and independent expenditure committees or other outside groups.

* **Compliance with Election Laws:**

* * * Adherence to general election laws, including regulations related to ballot access, voting rights, and election day procedures.

* **Compliance with Communication Rules:**

* * * Adherence to rules governing political communication, including disclaimers on campaign materials and compliance with rules related to robocalls, emails, and other forms of communication.

* **Legal Entity Designation:**

* * * Proper designation of the campaign's legal structure (e.g., PAC, Super PAC, candidate committee) with associated compliance requirements.

* **Filing and Reporting Deadlines:**

* * * Strict adherence to filing deadlines for financial reports, disclosure statements, and other required documents.

* **Independent Expenditure Reporting:**

* * * If applicable, reporting requirements for independent expenditures made by individuals or groups not directly affiliated with the campaign.

* **Coordination with Party Committees:**

* * Compliance with rules governing the coordination between campaigns and political party committees.

### **The Role of Software Solutions** ###

Software solutions, such as those offered by [ISPolitical](https://ispolitical.com/), present a game-changing approach to campaign finance management. They offer efficiency, accuracy, real-time insights, and continuous updates, empowering campaign teams to navigate the regulatory landscape with ease.

### Automation of Reporting Processes ###

One of the key features of good campaign financial compliance software is the automation of reporting processes. These tools can streamline the often labor-intensive task of generating accurate and timely financial reports.

### Compliance Alerts and Notifications ###

Effective software solutions provide proactive alerts and notifications, ensuring that campaign teams are informed about upcoming deadlines, changes in regulations, and potential [compliance](https://ispolitical.com/compliance/) issues.

### Political Accounting Software Support  ###

The importance of reliable support cannot be overstated. [ISPolitical](https://ispolitical.com/support/) support services assist campaign teams in utilizing their financial compliance software effectively, addressing queries, and resolving issues promptly.

### Political Accounting Software Security  ###

Given the sensitivity of campaign finance data, security is paramount. ISPolitical’s accounting suite has robust [security features](https://ispolitical.com/security/) built in, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of critical financial information.

### **Political Campaign Treasurers** ###

Campaign treasurers play a key role in financial management. ISPolitical’s suite of [software solutions is tailored to treasurers](https://ispolitical.com/treasurers/). It simplifies their responsibilities and enhances overall campaign finance compliance.

In conclusion, as political campaigns face increasingly complex regulatory landscapes, leveraging [software solutions](https://ispolitical.com/) becomes imperative. Through a comprehensive understanding of regulations and the utilization of cutting-edge tools, campaigns can not only navigate compliance challenges effectively but also build and maintain public trust in the democratic process.

# HOW DO I SET UP MY COMPLIANCE REPORTING

How Do I Set Up My Compliance Reporting?
==========

Setting up your database for Compliance reporting is an essential first step in ISP. This involves setting up your Filer and creating your committee’s record with committee IDs and other committee information, creating Treasurer, Candidate (if applicable), and other staff records, then linking them correctly.

Your Filer and committee’s records allow the system to generate Compliance reports with the accurate committee and financial information.

Create the Records first. To start, set up staff and candidate records (individual), then add the committee record (organization) and link the other records using Relationships. Make sure to include all pertinent data. ISP pulls data from these records to put on your compliance reports.

You’ll find further information on setting up Records and your Filer here:

# WHAT IS AN ACCRUED EXPENSE

What Is an Accrued Expense?
==========

An Accrued Expense is a type of debt that has a due or unpaid balance. For most reporting agencies, Accrued Expenses are reported in the period in which it is incurred.

While there are many different kinds and uses of Accrued Expenses, a few examples of an Accrued Expense would be loans with an amount still left to pay off, monthly credit card statements, wages due to staff, or monthly office space expenses. Essentially, anytime a debt is owed, an Accrued Expense transaction is used.

If you’d like to view the transactions related to your accrued expenses, one way to do this is to run a Transactions report and select Accrued Expenses as the Transaction Type. On each Accrued Expense, select the hotdog menu to view Related Transactions. This allows you to see any payments that have been made on the Accrued Expense.

Accrued Expenses are useful for accounting purposes because the expense is already recognized on the books before the payment has been made.

Once you add an Accrued Expense to your database, it will then be reflected in your [Balances](https://ispolitical.com/About-Balances).

If you have the Dropbox integration installed, you can add files to both Accrued Expenses and any related transactions.

# ABOUT FEC CONDUIT EARMARK MEMOS

About FEC Conduit (Earmark) Memos
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When a filer receives a contribution via an intermediary, typically called a conduit or earmark, there are associated disclosure requirements, specifically when it comes to disclosing the intermediary information. You may see Conduit Memos disclosed in various manners, but the way we disclose Conduit memos has been verified by the FEC.

* **For each itemized contribution via Conduit, we disclose a Conduit Memo.**
This is according to the [Campaign Finance Law 110.6 Earmarked contributions 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(8))](https://www.fec.gov/regulations/110-6/2023-annual-110#:~:text=30116(a)(8)),the%20person%20to%20the%20candidate.), specifically, Section C2c: The information required under 11 CFR 104.3(a) (3) and (4) for each earmarked contribution which in the aggregate exceeds $200 in any election cycle.

* **The Amount on the Conduit Memo is the amount of the transfer.**
This amount is the whole/parent amount of the individual contribution. Again, this is according to the Campaign Finance Law 110.6 Earmarked contributions 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(8)), specifically, Section C2b: The total amount of earmarked contributions received from the conduit or intermediary and the date of receipt.

* **The Date of the Conduit Memo is the date of the transfer.**
This is can be found on the FEC’s site on [how to report contributions received through conduits](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/contributions-received-through-conduits/). In the example, Mary Smith gave via conduit Mount Vernon Association PAC. Mount Vernon Association PAC is the conduit and is reported as a memo item supporting Mary Smith’s contribution. The Date of Receipt will be the date the conduit gave the contribution to the committee. This date may be later than the date disclosed with Mary’s information.

# ABOUT SUPER PACS

About Super PACs
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

What are Super PACs? Super PACs are independent expenditure-only political committees that may receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other political action committees for the purpose of financing independent expenditures and other independent political activity. These committees are not limited on what contributions they can receive or spend, but they cannot give directly to candidates or regular PACs.

A Super PAC becomes a political committee once its contributions or expenditures exceed $1,000 in a calendar year. After the committee crosses that threshold, it must register within 10 days, using the Statement of Organization, Form 1. A PAC may register and begin reporting before it exceeds the $1,000 threshold.

If you need to remove limit warnings from your account, change your Committee Type on your filer record to Super PAC.

# HOW DO I USE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS FOR VIRTUAL ACCOUNTING

How Do I Use Financial Accounts for Virtual Accounting?
==========

Virtual financial accounts are commonly used in accounting for tracking funds. For example, you may have a financial account designated for payroll or petty cash. They do not match an actual bank financial account, but can be used to track separately a variety of expenses or incomes.

There is no limit to the number of financial accounts you can create in ISP. Each financial account is associated with a filer. If you have just one filer in your account, then all of them are associated with that filer. All transactions in your financial accounts will pull to reports based on the filer associated with that financial account. As far as compliance accounting goes, it does not matter where your transactions are. This allows for flexibility in tracking finances via virtual financial accounts.

How do I move funds between financial accounts?
----------

To indicate money moving from a financial account representing an actual bank account and a virtual account, use the Internal Transfer transaction type.

1. Navigate to Accounting and select Add Transaction.
2. Select Internal Transfer transaction type.
3. Set the To and From Accounts. This will tell the system what account to pull funds from and where to put it.

Once created, you will see two Internal Transfer transactions. One will be negative in the financial account money is pulled from, and the other will be positive in the financial account the money is put. Neither will appear on a compliance report and is purely internal. They do, however, pull to Bank reconciliations and other internal financial reports for accounting.

# WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEC CANDIDATE IDS AND COMMITTEE IDS

What Is the Difference Between FEC Candidate IDs and Committee IDs?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When filing with the FEC, you will work with two FEC IDs: your Candidate ID and Committee ID. Both FEC IDs will be 9 characters long and alpha-numeric. They are not randomly generated numbers; your Committee ID will always start with C00, but the Candidate ID will look different based on your Candidate’s election.

**Candidate ID**

Candidate ID will not change over time, as long as your candidate is running for the same office. *H2IA03101* and *S2IA00172* are both examples of a Candidate ID running for office in Iowa.

The FEC ID starting with H means the candidate is running for House and the ID starting with S is running for Senate. Then the ID will have the state’s abbreviation within the ID.

**Committee IDs**

Committee IDs will always start with *C00* (C-zero-zero) and the ID does not change once it is handed out. *C00784082* and *C00791525* are both examples of a Committee IDs for Candidates running for office in Iowa.

# WRONG FEC PASSWORD ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING

Wrong FEC Password Error Troubleshooting
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

If you receive an error regarding an incorrect password when filing your FEC report, there are a few things to consider and try

If you’ve forgotten your password, you can reset that on the [FEC Forgot Password](https://fecnotify.fec.gov/fecnotify/forgot-password/) page.

First, verify you can log into the [FEC webforms site](https://webforms.fec.gov/webforms/form1/login.htm). If it works, that means the password is valid.

Next, confirm the committee ID is correct in the committee record in ISP. This information is located in the Committee Info section. If you need to update it, click the triangle in the top right corner of the section.

If you have your password saved in ISP, check the Password Safe to be sure the password is correct. Password Safe will show after you generate the report and click the e-file button.

If these are correct, try filing again. Maintenance or a communication problem with the FEC submission servers can happen and sometime can result in an invalid password message. Waiting a short while then trying again might yield different results.

If the above aren’t the cause or don’t correct the issue, try filing directly with the Webform link above. If it works, it may be a there was a server communication issue when you attempted to file.

The last option would be to contact the FEC. If there is an issue with the e-filing and/or the password, they will be able to assist directly with the issue.

# WHAT IS THE CALENDAR AND RECURRING CALENDAR ENTRIES

What Is the Calendar and Recurring Calendar Entries?
==========

The Calendar in ISP allows you to schedule important dates and events, including linking any staff members involved.

When viewing the Calendar, you have different displays to choose from. You can view in the traditional calendar boxed view, or use the list view to see the events in a list fashion. Select your preferred view with the Month/List buttons in the top right corner. You can also scroll through the months or yearly list with the arrows in the top left corner.

The Calendar works in conjunction with [Calendar Feeds](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-Calendar-Feeds/) and allows you to automatically have calendar events show up on your personal Google or Outlook calendar.

What are recurring calendar entries?
----------

On the Calendar view page, you can add calendar entries, whether they’re single one-off events or if they’re recurring events. If you have events that happen frequently on a recurring schedule, such as weekly meetings, paydays, or birthdays, you can create events that happen on a recurring basis so you don’t have to repeatedly add them to the calendar.

You have two options to add recurring calendar entries, either by the Add Recurring Entry button or the associated page that displays a list view of recurring calendar entries. Click the Recurring Calendar Entries button to navigate to that page.

When you add a recurring calendar entry, you’ll have multiple options for scheduling and assigning the calendar event.

In the window that opens, the top section labeled First Event is where you’ll set up the main details of the event, including the Type and Description. Use the Start and End Date fields to set when the event starts. Select All Day if it’s an all day event or set the time frame the event will run from. You can also specify who sees the event in the calendar, whether it’s a certain user or group of users or if it’s all users in the database.

The second section, Recurring Rules, allows you to set the specific recurring details of the event.

The Frequency option lets you determine if the event is a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual event. For monthly and yearly events, depending on the specific Start Date, you’ll also be able to determine whether the recurring event happens on that specific day of the month or any other relative date related to when it falls in the month.

Monthly and Yearly options also provide more advanced options, such as weekend handling. If the event will happen on a weekend, you can choose the following options:

* **Allow Weekends:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, it will remain on that day on the calendar.
* **Skip Weekends:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, the event will not be scheduled for that month.
* **Closest Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, the event will be listed on either Friday or Monday, depending on if the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday.
* **Next Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday, the event will be listed on the following Monday.
* **Previous Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday, the event will fall on the Friday before.

# WHAT RECORDS ARE NEEDED FOR COMPLIANCE REPORTING

What Records are Needed for Compliance Reporting?
==========

Setting up your database for Compliance reporting is an important first step in ISP. This involves creating your committee’s record with committee IDs and other committee information, as well as creating Treasurer, Candidate (if applicable), and other staff records, then linking them correctly.

To start, set up staff and candidate records, then add the committee record and link other records.

### How do I set up the Candidate record? ###

1. Click Add/Search, then Individuals.

2. Enter the name of the candidate you are going to set up, then Search. If you had ISP import data for you, you may already have the candidate’s record in your database. If so, you can bypass the creation of the candidate or treasurer record and click on the name in the search results instead to review the details for accuracy.

3. If the candidate is not already in the system, click the Add Individual button.

4. In the window that appears, complete the basic information fields, then click the Is Candidate box.

5. New fields will appear that will allow you to enter in Candidate info, such as Office Sought data and Party. If the Candidate already holds office, select the Office Held tab and complete details there.

6. Once you’ve added all the necessary details, click the Add Individual button.

If you don’t have some details and need to enter them later, there is a Candidate Info section within the candidate’s record where you will be able to add and edit details when you receive them.

### How do I set up the Treasurer record? ###

Setting up the Treasurer record is no different than setting up a standard Individual record. You can follow steps 1 through 3 above, skipping steps 4 and 5, to add the record to the system. Once the committee record is set up, you’ll be able to link the Treasurer record to the committee record at that time.

### How do I set up the Committee record? ###

1. Click Add/Search, then Organizations.

2. Enter the name of the committee you are going to set up, then click Search. As mentioned above, if you had ISPolitical import data for you, you may already have the committee record in your database.

3. If the committee is not already in the database, click Search. If you have turned on the option to include results found via your agency’s filing database and your committee is already registered with the agency, you may see your committee in the results.

It’s important to note the feature for agency related results is limited to Federal and specific state agencies that have made the data available in this way. If you do not see this option on the Account Management page, it is because those details through your filing agency are not available.

4. If you don’t see your committee in the results, click Add Organization at the bottom of the screen.

5. In the window that appears, click the Type dropdown and select Political Committee. New fields will open on the right where you will enter in various committee details you have available to you. Like candidate records, data can be added or edited at a later time.

Be aware that your Committee Type can often determine the available Compliance reports on the reporting page. Be sure you have the correct Committee Type selected. If when attempting to generate a report and you don’t see it in the list, most likely the Committee Type needs to be corrected.

6. Once you’ve added the basic details and other committee information, click the Add Organization button.

Once you’ve added the committee record, you’ll automatically land in the record itself. At this point you’ll need to link the Treasurer, as well as any applicable committee staff, the candidate included.

### How do I link staff records to the committee? ###

1. In the Relationships section on the right, click the green triangle in the top right corner.

2. In the Affiliated field, start typing the name of the treasurer. This runs a search on your database for a matching record.

3. Click the name of the committee’s Treasurer.

4. Select Treasurer relationship from the Relationship Type dropdown menu.

5. Click Add Relationship to save the relationship, or click Add & New to save and add another relationship (i.e. Candidate or other committee staff members).

# WHICH BROWSER SHOULD I USE

Which Browser Should I Use?
==========

While Google Chrome works fine for ISP in most scenarios, we recommend using Firefox as your browser. We do a lot with dynamic content, and Firefox handles it better. Firefox also has the ability to right-click anywhere on the browser and take a full-page screenshot:

1. Right-click anywhere on your browser
2. Select Take Screenshot
3. In the window that appears, select the Save Full Page option

You can click [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) to download Firefox.

Chrome has some limitations when it comes to some of our software, including the inability to handle large amounts of information loading onto one page. Something like an all-time report of transactions in an account seems to be too much for Chrome to handle.

An exception to our recommendation that you use Firefox as your browser in ISP is if you are working on an iOS device (iPad, iPhone). In this scenario, we recommend using Safari (the native browser) rather than Firefox. If you are working on a Mac (desktop, laptop), however, we recommend using Firefox rather than Safari.

# WHAT IS CALL TIME AND HOW DO I USE IT

What Is Call Time and How Do I Use It?
==========

In ISP, you can use Call Time to create a script or outline to help when contacting entities in your database. This script, while in Call Time mode, will show at the top of the record and help guide you through your communication with the individual.

The first step is to create your script in [Call Time Settings](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-Call-Time-Settings/). These can be created for specific users in your database, as well.

Call Time works in conjunction with Reminders. Once you set up Call Time for either yourself or another user, and if there are current or past due Reminders assigned to you or that user, a button will show on the Dashboard allowing entry into Call Time mode. Once you click it, you’ll be taken to the first record in your list of Reminders. If you have multiple records, there will be buttons in the bottom left and right corners of each record to jump to the next individual in the Reminders list.

At the top of the screen in each record in the Reminders list, you’ll see the script you created in Call Time Settings. This will only appear when you are in Call Time mode. When calling or contacting the individual, you can use the script to guide your communication.

After you’ve contacted the individual, click the Record Communication button at the bottom of the screen. In the window that appears, complete the fields outlining and noting the communication you made with the individual, then click Record Communication.

# WHAT DO I NEED TO FILE AN AMENDED FORM 1

What Do I Need to File an Amended Form 1?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 1 pulls information from the Filer Record. Please be sure to edit the necessary information in ISP before filing your amendment.

When filing an amended Form 1 out of ISP, you must first have the committee’s original FEC Filing ID. To locate the committee’s original FEC Filing ID:

1. Navigate to the FEC website
2. Type your Committee ID Number into the search field and click the magnifying glass icon
3. Click your Committee Name
4. On your Committee page, select FILINGS from the left sidebar menu
5. On the Committee Filings page, select the appropriate TWO-YEAR PERIOD in this field’s drop-down menu
6. Scroll down to the Statements of organization section
7. Click the relevant Statement of Organization document to retrieve your FEC Identification Number

In ISP, your Committee ID Number is located in the Committee Info section of the Filer Record. To access and/or update your Filer Record:

1. From anywhere in the system, click the magnifying glass next to the Logout button
2. In the drop-down search box, type the committee name, then select the committee name
3. On the committee page, click the green triangle in the corner of the Committee Info section header
4. In the Update Committee Info window, enter any necessary changes
5. Click the green Update Committee Info button

If you want to verify and/or update the Treasurer, scroll down to the Relationships section in the Filer Record to see whether a Treasurer record is linked. If not, follow these steps:

1. Ensure there is an existing Individual record for the Treasurer (if not, create one before proceeding to Step 2)
2. Click the green triangle in the Relationships section header
3. Enter the required information in the Add Relationship window
4. Click the green Add Relationship button

Your bank account tied to the filer may also need updating or verification. To access your bank account:

1. From wherever you are in the database, navigate to Lists, then to Financial Accounts
2. Click the appropriate bank account
3. In the Update window, enter any necessary changes
4. Click the green Update Bank button

Once you are ready to generate and file the amended Form 1, navigate to Compliance Reports under the Reports tab, select FEC Form 1 from the Compliance Report field drop-down menu, and check the Amended checkbox. After you hit the Amended box, three more fields will pop up. This allows you to select the report you’re amending, enter that report’s original report number, and enter what amendment number it is.

1. If a filer previously only filed paper Form 1s and were planning to file an amendment to that Form 1 electronically, they would
mark it as new, not amended. The FEC’s system would automatically
identify it as an amendment upon upload.
2. If a filer is amending a Form 1 that was previously filed
electronically, they would mark it as amended and then use the Filing
ID of the original report that was first filed electronically. The
amendment number would be the sequence number of how many times the
original electronically filed Form 1 has now been amended.

In addition to the Amended checkbox, you will see four other checkboxes: Change of Address, Change of Email, Change of Name, and Change of URL (if your committee’s website has changed). You can check as many checkboxes as apply.

Note: If you have previously filed a paper version of Form 1 and this is the first time submitting an electronic version, you will need to file the report as an original rather than as an amendment.

Understanding the importance of and adhering to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing deadlines is crucial for any political campaign. Staying compliant with FEC filing regulations not only helps to avoid penalties but also ensures that campaigns maintain their reputation and legitimacy–two things a campaign cannot afford to slack on. This guide provides a detailed overview of upcoming FEC filing deadlines, a clear calendar of key dates, and insights into how software can streamline compliance.

What is FEC Filing?
----------

FEC filing is a mandatory process for political campaigns, political action committees (PACs), and other entities involved in federal elections. These entities must regularly report their financial activities to the FEC, including contributions, expenditures, and loans. FEC filing deadlines are crucial, as missing them can lead to fines, legal issues, and loss of credibility for the campaign.

FEC Filing Calendar: Upcoming Deadlines
----------

Staying aware of upcoming FEC filing deadlines is essential for all political entities. Here is a calendar of forthcoming major deadlines that campaigns need to keep in mind:

* **July Quarterly Filing Deadline:** July 15, 2024. Campaigns must submit their financial activities report for the second quarter of 2024.
* **Pre-Primary Filing Deadlines:** These vary by state, typically occurring 12 days before the state's primary election. Campaigns should check the specific dates for their state to avoid missing these filings.
* **October Quarterly Filing Deadline:** October 15, 2024. This deadline covers financial activities from July 1 to September 30.
* **Pre-General Filing Deadline:** October 24, 2024. This filing is crucial for campaigns participating in the November general elections. Reports must be submitted 12 days before the election.
* **Post-General Filing Deadline:** December 5, 2024. Covers financial activities up to 20 days after the November election.

FEC Filing Schedule: Maintaining Compliance
----------

Maintaining compliance with the FEC filing calendar is crucial for campaigns to avoid penalties. Here’s how your campaign can stay on track:

* **Mark Your Calendar:** Make sure all upcoming deadlines are marked and notifications are set. Include these notifications on all personnel’s calendars who are affected by FEC filing.
* **Prepare in Advance:** Organize your campaign's financial records regularly to ensure you can quickly compile and submit accurate reports. Making sure you give yourself time to resolve any inconsistencies or find missing information will help you stay ahead.
* **Use Software:** Software solutions, [like ours](https://ispolitical.com/), can automate the tracking of financial activities, generate reports, and provide reminders for upcoming FEC filings. This minimizes the risk of missing deadlines and ensures full compliance.

==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

Imagine a tool specifically designed to manage the financial side of political campaigns – the donations, the expenses, the financial and compliance reports…that's political campaign accounting software in a nutshell. It's the unsung hero behind the scenes, ensuring that campaign finances are well-organized, transparent, and compliant with all the nitty-gritty regulations.

The Importance of Effective Accounting in Political Campaigns
----------

### Legitimate campaigns get serious with accounting. ###

Picture this: a political campaign in financial chaos. Poor record keeping and unaccounted-for expenditures, with possible compliance violations…It's a recipe for disaster. Effective accounting is the backbone of a successful campaign. It prevents huge fines, protects reputations, gives peace of mind to donors, and ultimately sets the stage for victory. Enter good political accounting software – the guardian angel of campaign finances.

Political Campaign/PAC Accounting Software Features and Uses
----------

Political campaign accounting software isn’t just a ledger of money in and money out. It should have features built into it that help manage all the aspects of campaign finances, which can be tricky and can vary from state to state. Good software should have some basic features specifically tailored to political committees:

### Recording and Managing Campaign Contributions ###

Ever wonder how campaigns keep track of who's contributing what? That's where good software shines. It not only records every dime but also ensures donations stay within legal limits, making the whole contribution process a breeze for supporters.

### Compliance with Legal Regulations and Contribution Limits ###

Navigating the labyrinth of campaign finance laws is no small feat. Good software acts as a guide, keeping campaigns compliant with federal and state regulations and catching anything that doesn’t add up. It's like having a legal advisor at your fingertips.

### Expense Tracking and Monitoring Campaign Expenditures ###

Think of compliance management as good software's superpower. It ensures campaigns dance to the rhythm of federal and state regulations, especially those laid out by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). It's the ultimate guardian of transparency and accountability.

### Federal and State Regulations ###

Campaigning isn't one-size-fits-all. Different regions, different rules. Good political accounting software is versatile, adapting to the specific compliance requirements of each state and the overarching federal regulations.

### Understanding and Adhering to Campaign Finance Laws ###

Good software provides features to seamlessly adhere to complex regulations The best political software vendors spend thousands of hours and serious resources studying and analyzing regulations and rulings to make sure their software handles each little nuance and exception.

The FEC has its own set of guidelines. Good political campaign accounting software acts as a compliance ally, creates and e-files compliance reports, ensuring campaigns meet FEC requirements – from timely reporting to accurate financial disclosure.

### Maintaining a Detailed Audit Trail for Financial Transactions ###

Ever heard of a digital paper trail? That's what good accounting software creates – a detailed audit trail for every financial move.

Political committees regularly need help an hour before a filing deadline. Only great companies offer that kind of help.

Training and Support
----------

How adept is your campaign team at using your accounting software? Can you imagine everyone getting the hang of the software with ease? That's the magic of training resources and great customer support.

# HOW DO I MEET FLORIDA S 1 6 7 1 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN ISP

How Do I Meet Florida’s 106.0701 Reporting Requirements in ISP?
==========

Applies To: Florida

Florida Statute 106.0701 requires that candidates for certain offices who solicit contributions for 527 Political Organizations or 501(c)(4)s must report those contributions received and expenditures made on their website within 5 business days.

We’ve created a way to meet these requirements via a tool in the Tools tab. This will provide a HTML page with Contributions and Expenditures to meet those requirements and it is updated every night by our AI system.

How do I add the FL reporting tool?
----------

1. Navigate to Tools \> Add/Remove Tools
2. Locate the tool called Florida 106.0701 Reporting and click to add it
3. You will receive an email no later than the next day with a link to the HTML page you can use

If you don’t have any transactions entered that would pull for this report, an email with the link will not be sent until that criteria is met.

The link will look something like this:

https://files.ISPolitical.com/content/clients/[LowercaseShortDisplayName]/FL1060701.html

These links are case-sensitive. Be sure you copy it directly from the email.

If needed, please refer to your website provider for specific instructions on how to add custom HTML into your website design.

We recommend you embed this in an iFrame on your webpage to satisfy the reporting requirement and to make full use of the automation done by AI. The AI automation will keep this page current with the data in your account.

Sample code of what it will look like in an iFrame:

\<iframe src=”https://files.ISPolitical.com/content/clients/[LowercaseShortDisplayName]/FL1060701.html” title=”FL106.0701″\>\</iframe\>

Example with an ISP account name in it:

\<iframe src=”https://files.ISPolitical.com/content/clients/gwashington/FL1060701.html” title=”FL106.0701″\>\</iframe\>

How to embed this code into your webpage can vary slightly between providers, but here is a link to one explaining the process:

# 2024 POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SOFTWARE HIGHLIGHTS

2024 Political Campaign Software Highlights
==========

<img alt="Group 342@2x" src="https://ispolitical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group-342@2x.png" title="Group 342@2x" height="1296" width="2732" />

Navigating the Political Software Landscape: Adapting to the Changing Tides of Technology and Regulation
----------

There’s a world of political campaign technology and accounting software out there, and staying ahead of the curve is not just a preference; it's a necessity. The landscape of accounting software is being shaped by the intersection of political compliance market consolidation, AI assistants, regulatory changes, and hosting technologies. Let’s take a closer look at what’s in store for 2024.

Political Compliance Firms Must Grow or Die
----------

In 2008, political committees used volunteers, inhouse treasures, and the odd smattering of small professional political compliance firms. In 2024, political committees only want to hire the best professional firms. There is a mass consolidation in the market. The professionals who use the best tools and practices are gobbling up all the clients while the pros and firms who fail to adapt see their client bases shrinking. 2024 will see the end of many old pros who failed to adapt and soaring profits from adaptable professional firms.

AI Assistant Revolutionizing FEC and Empowering Reports
----------

The integration of AI assistants in political campaign technology and accounting software marks a significant paradigm shift. These intelligent tools streamline the process of handling FEC (Federal Election Commission) regulations and empower users to generate more accurate and efficient reports. As regulatory requirements become more stringent, AI becomes a valuable ally in ensuring compliance and avoiding pitfalls.

The Growing Sting of Regulatory Enforcement
----------

Regulatory agencies are ramping up their efforts with improved tools to catch non-compliance. The days of flying under the radar are dwindling, and political software providers must be prepared for heightened scrutiny. More audits will be conducted, and your books need to be in ship shape unless you want trouble. It’s important to know the implications of increased enforcement and how software solutions can proactively address regulatory challenges.

The Evolution of Hosting Technologies
----------

### Small Hosting, Big Problem ###

The backbone of political software lies in hosting, and small hosting providers are facing substantial challenges. From security concerns to scalability issues, there are hurdles that smaller hosting services must overcome to stay competitive.

### The Internet's 3rd Generation of Hosting ###

Tracing the evolution of hosting, one can see the shift from early computer-to-computer connections to the co-location era where servers were kept in large rooms. However, co-location services are showing signs of strain, and understanding the reasons behind their vulnerabilities is crucial for the software providers relying on them.

### Cloud Computing: A Game-Changer ###

The rise of cloud hosting has transformed the industry, taking it from small businesses to publicly traded companies. We are seeing the obvious benefits and implications of this shift and the necessity for co-location services to transition to the cloud. One of the potential risks associated with remaining in co-location are the chances of major outages in 2024.

ISP is in the Cloud
----------

As imminent outages threaten to disrupt operations and communications, cloud-based software becomes vital. Cloud storage and hosting provides enhanced reliability, scalability, and overall performance. Unfortunately, most political accounting softwares continue to operate under the computer-to-computer and co-location models. Not ISPolitical.

Political Campaign Accounting Technology
----------

Software is technology, and great software needs to keep pace with the ever-evolving landscape of functionality, regulation, and hosting, among other things. With political campaign technology and accounting software, adaptation is key. From embracing AI assistants for regulatory compliance to navigating changing hosting technologies, staying informed and proactive is essential for software providers.

Don’t let your accounts suffer because of an outage or an innocent reporting error. As regulations change and regulatory agencies increase their vigilance, your campaign accounting software needs to be air-tight. ISPolitical stays on the bleeding edge of tech and trade, so our software never falls behind. If you would like to learn more, don’t hesitate to [reach out](https://ispolitical.com/contact/). We’d be happy to answer your questions!

# HOW DO I ADD NEW EXISTING USERS TO A DATABASE

How Do I Add New & Existing Users to a Database?
==========

User roles play an important part in not just what staff and volunteers have access to but can also be vital in protecting data integrity and security. Many user roles are available, and while some roles have the same permissions, each one will have its limitations.

### How do I add a new user? ###

In the System tab, select Users. On the resulting screen, you’ll see a list of all the users in your database. To add one, click the Add User button at the bottom of the screen.

A window will appear and require you to enter in Name and Email information.

It’s very important to remember that an incorrect email address will prevent the new user from being able to access the system. If the email address is incorrect, they will not receive the email containing their login information.

You’ll also have fields that determine which Account database you’d like to give the user access to, as well as the Role you’d like to assign them. If you work with multiple databases, you’ll see the full list of databases to choose from.

When selecting a Role, you can view the [permissions each user role carries](https://ispolitical.com/user-permissions-in-isp/). Some will have more access to database features and functionalities than others.

Once you have completed the fields, click the Add User button. That individual will receive a welcome email containing their account and login information.

### How do I add an existing user to a database? ###

This is similar to the steps above, in that you would access this from the same location, under the System tab.

In the window that appears, you’ll notice two tabs: New ISP User and Existing User(s). The default will show the New ISP User option, but when adding an already existing user to a database, be sure to click the Existing User(s) tab.

# WHAT ARE MEMOS SPLITS AND HOW DO I ADD THEM

What Are Memos & Splits and How Do I Add Them?
==========

Splits and Memos are an important part of campaign finance, especially when it comes to compliance reports. Not having the correct data entry can cause non-compliant reports, as well as cause confusion with financial totals in ISP.

### What is the difference between a Split and a Memo? ###

Finance Splits are parts of other transactions. The most common examples are the end vendors with credit card payments and Reimbursements, and also checks from conduits where you’re itemizing the source donations.

A finance Memo is a shadow version of a transaction with no actual financial impact. Memos are standalone transactions. While they may be related to another transfer, they are not part of it. A common example would be Redesignations and donated legal services, which are not considered In-kind contributions.

Neither Memos nor Splits have any impact on cash or net worth.

### How do I add a Split or Memo? ###

**Splits**

At the bottom of the transaction is a Splits section. Click the Specify Splits button to add a Split. You’ll then receive fields for Entity, Date, and more. If you are creating an Expense for a donation made to another committee, the general rule when it comes to which Election is to use the same election for the memo as was used for the parent Election above.

If you want to delete a transaction with Splits, you must delete the Splits first before you can delete the transaction as a whole.

If the Split is dated before the election and the Whole is dated after the election, the Split will pull with the Whole after the election if the Whole is itemized.

**Memo**

Create the transaction the standard way. The option to mark the transaction as a Memo will be at the top and labeled Is Memo.

What is a nested split?
----------

A nested split is a split of a split. We do NOT recommend data entry that creates a nested split. This can cause calculation discrepancies and other issues, most notably on compliance reports.

# WHY ARE MY ACCRUED EXPENSES NOT ITEMIZING ON SCHEDULE D

Why Are My Accrued Expenses Not Itemizing on Schedule D?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

If your Accrued Expenses are not itemizing on Schedule D on the Form 3 or 3X, they may just not be meeting the necessary requirements to be itemized. Accrued Expenses will itemize on Schedule D if they meet either one of two requirements:

1. If they have been outstanding for 60 days or more, they will itemize regardless of the balance or original amount

**OR**

2. If they have an original amount, beginning balance, or outstanding balance of $500.01 or more

If they don’t meet either of these conditions, then they will not itemize on Schedule D.

# HOW DO I ADD THE TARGETED VICTORY INTEGRATION

How Do I Add the Targeted Victory Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

In order to set up the integration between Targeted Victory and ISP, first navigate to the Integrations tab, then click Add/Remove. Scroll down to the Available section until you see the Targeted Victory, then click on it to add it to the database.

At this point, you’ll need to contact the support team at Targeted Victory to assist you with the completion process of creating the integration between the two systems.

Once the integration is fully set up, ISP will automatically create a Targeted Victory record in the ISP account with Targeted Victory’s details.

When data is passed over to ISP, it will end up in the [Pending Imports](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) section of your Dashboard.

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Targeted Victory via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Targeted Victory will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.

# HOW DO I PRINT CHECKS

How Do I Print Checks?
==========

The Print Check feature allows you print expenses to various check formats based on your needs or preferences.

Each format allows for both a pre-lined check or a simple blank stock check. You also have the option of a middle-layout check, which can be ordered from Multi Business System at 800-767-1383.

If you have multiple checks to print, you can select a number to use for the first check by entering that number in the Starting Check # field. This is directly above the Check Format drop down menu.

If you don’t see the check you need to print, it’s possible you have a Check Number already in the transaction details. If so, remove the Check Number from the details of the transaction and return to this page to print the check.

At the bottom of the screen is a button labeled Manage Check Details. Clicking this button directs you to a page where you can add banking information for each financial account in your database, such as bank name and address, or account and routing number. You also have the options of setting approval rules and including a signature image. Once you’ve set these, click Print Checks to return to the list of transactions available to print to a check.

After you’ve set the criteria and any check details, you can then select checks to print by checking the box to the left of each transaction. You can select one or many of them. If you’d like to select all of them at once, in the top left corner of the transactions list, to the left of the Financial Account column header, you’ll see a standalone check box. Checking this selects or de-selects all at once.

Please note that checks six months prior to the current date will not show in the list of available checks to print.

Once ready to print, click the Generate button at the bottom of the screen. This will prepare the check or checks to be downloaded anywhere to your computer as a PDF. From there you can open them and print out to the check stock loaded into your printer.

# WHAT IS TWO FACTOR AUTHORIZATION AND HOW DO I SET IT UP

What Is Two Factor Authorization and How Do I Set It Up?
==========

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra security step to your basic log-in procedure.

Without 2FA, you enter in your username and password, and then you’re done. The password is your single factor of authentication. The second factor makes your account much more secure. After setting up 2FA, you will be asked to confirm your account every 30-days and whenever you use a new device or browser to sign in.

In order to set up 2FA, first, go to the Settings Menu, then select Two-Factor Authentication. On the resulting screen, you’ll see two locations to choose from when setting up 2FA, My Settings and My Accounts.

**My Settings**: This will make it so every account you log into will require 2FA.

**My Account**: Here you can choose specific accounts to require 2FA (Your login has to have this enabled in My Settings as well).

How do I set up Two Factor Authentication for my login?
----------

1. Navigate to the Settings Menu (Gear Icon) and Select Two-Factor Authentication from the drop down menu.

2. Under the section that says My Settings click the blue button + Set Up Two-Factor Authentication.

3. A pop up will appear where you can turn on 2FA, select a method to receive your code (SMS is the most common way), and a phone number to associate with the 2FA.

4. Log out and back in. You will be prompted to enter a code sent to you by one of the methods selected.

What are the different Two Factor Authentication methods?
----------

**SMS**
Send a text message with a one-time passcode to your mobile device.

**Phone Call**

Receive a call with a one-time passcode.

**TOTP**

For first time users, you’ll be requested to install an app on your phone which will generate a one-time code to enter on the log in.

**One-Touch**

Using the same app as TOTP, tap the Requests option in the top left corner. In Pending, you’ll see a pending request. Tapping that will give you Deny or Approve options. The moment you tap Approve, ISP will automatically log you in.

If you do not receive the SMS Message or the TOTP/One Touch notification we recommend a few things. Make sure that to desired 2FA method is in place. Please ensure the correct phone number is on file in ISP. Check to see if the app is updated. If it is please uninstall then reinstall and try again.

If you choose SMS or TOTP as your 2FA method, the My Settings section will be an option to resend the Authy install link to your phone if you need to reinstall it.

# ABOUT THE CA FORM 497 REPORT

About the CA Form 497 Report
==========

Applies To: California

The CA Form 497 has two main uses:

1. Primarily, a 24-hour Contribution Report, which is required for contributions received or non-independent expenditure made in the amount or aggregate of $1,000 or more, filed within the 90-day period before an election
2. A 10-day report, required for contributions received or non-independent expenditures made in the amount or aggregate of $5,000 or more, filed anytime outside of the 90-day period before an election

Every time a donation is made, the aggregate resets back to $0.

Determining when contributions should pull to a FPPC Form 497 can be confusing. Here are a few examples to help demonstrate situations that are most common.

**Example 1:** A donor gives $800 in aggregate outside of the 90-day reporting period. They then donate $500 in the 90-day reporting period. This $500 amount would not pull because it’s under the $1,000 aggregate amount for the 90-day reporting period.

**Example 2:** A donor gave $500 in the 90-day reporting period. They then give another $600 in the same 90-day reporting period. This donor now aggregates to $1,000 or more in the 90-day reporting period and will need to be reported on a 497.

**Example 3:** A donor gives $1,100 in the 90-day reporting period. This is reported on a 497. The donor then gives another $700 in the 90-day reporting period. This $700 amount is not reported on a 497 because the aggregate has reset back to $0 when the first 497 was filed.

Furthermore, if you are expecting a contribution made (expense to another committee) to pull to a 497 and it is not, then consider these two scenarios:

1. Since the 497, or 24-hour Contribution Report, is based on Support/Oppose Memos, check to make sure there is a Support/Oppose Memo on the contribution made transaction you’re expecting to report.
2. A Political Action Committee (PAC) does not have to report Contributions Received, so Page 1 is automatically excluded for PAC filers.

Please note when the State created the e-filing specifications for the Form 497, they did not add a section where the loan box can be checked. Instead, the document note is used to indicate that it is a loan. The loan box cannot be checked when e-filed; only when paper filed.

When contributions are made to state or local races using federal funds, the itemization rules slightly change. There is no reset, and the contributions made are reported as info, or what we would call memo. These expenses will itemize once they reach the $1,000 threshold and will continue to itemize.

On the other hand, non-federal expenses do reset after they hit the $1,000 threshold.

In order to avoid confusion, we include a memo for every expense. These memos indicate if the expense was made as a member communication and if it was made in support of or in opposition to.

# HOW DO I RECORD LOANS

How Do I Record Loans?
==========

When entering in Loans, whether Loan Received or Loan Made, it is vital to keep in mind that you are recording the transaction from the point of view of the Committee.

To enter in a Loan Received, fill in the entity field with who gave the loan to the Committee. In most cases, it is the candidate but could also be from another donor or a bank. Other fields will populate, though not all fields are required. Be sure to fill out the fields that are applicable to keep your information correct.

To enter a Loan Made you will fill in the entity field for who the Committee gave a loan to. This is a rare situation. An example of this situation would be if a candidate is being reimbursed for an expense that was not considered a qualified expense and must pay the Committee back.

Once you add a Loan to your database, it will then be reflected in your [Balances](https://ispolitical.com/About-Balances).

# DO I NEED TO FILE THE IRS FORM 8871 8872

Do I Need to File the IRS Form 8871/8872?
==========

Applies To: Internal Revenue Service

Please be aware that for more official advice, you will need to contact the IRS. We can only provide information based on guidelines we read and interpret. The IRS and other governmental agencies will always be the final word.

Who files the IRS reports?
----------

Most political candidate committees don’t need to file this if they have been filing FEC reports and the candidate contributions or expenses have been used in support of the candidate the committee was primarily formed for. A large portion of our clients that need to file the 8872 are multi-state PAC’s or 527 organizations.

That said, the IRS is more clear on who does NOT file file the reports instead of who does.

The following political organizations are not required to file Form 8871:

* Any organization required to report to the Federal Election Commission as a political committee
* Committees of state or local candidates, State or local committees of a political party
* Any organization reasonably anticipating that it will always have less than $25,000 for any taxable year.

The following political organizations are not required to file Form 8872:

* Organizations that are not required to file Form 8871
* Qualified state and local political organizations

There are situations where a committee is required to file with the FEC and also needs to file an 8872. However, those are mostly 527 organizations and committees that take contributions and have expenses in support of candidates NOT directly linked to the committee (i.e. many PACs).

As stated above, the IRS will have the final say on if and when you will need to file those reports. Please be sure to use this help file only as surface level guidance prior to contacting the IRS with your questions.

# WHY ARE MY FEC REPORTS AGGREGATING DIFFERENTLY IN ISP

Why Are My FEC Reports Aggregating Differently in ISP?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When you import data from other software into ISP, you may notice that Line 11(a)i and Line 11(a)ii on your new report are different than your previous software. This is because there are spots in the FEC documentation that are up to interpretation.

Because of that uncertainty, there are variances between software programs in certain areas. For example, some programs itemize at $200 while others itemize at $200.01 (the ISP threshold). Some use static aggregation, meaning they aggregate as of the last day of the report, while others, including ISP, have running aggregation, where aggregates are on a day-to-day basis.

These variances cause Lines 11(a)i and 11(a)ii to differ from program to program. The FEC is aware and okay with these variances. The important part that the FEC cares about most is Line 11(a)iii. As long as that value is consistent, then there’s generally nothing to worry about.
