 How Do I Create Drip Campaigns & Drip Emails?
==========

Drip Campaigns are a great way to spread the word about events or other campaign communication. Within Drip Campaigns are Drip Emails, which are designed to send a series of emails staggered over a set period of time.

For example, if you have an upcoming fundraiser event, each day leading up to it you can send an email to interested constituents.

The first step is to establish a Drip Campaign.

How do I create a Drip Campaign?
----------

Navigate to the Drip Campaigns option under the Tools tab and on the resulting screen, click the [Add Drip Campaign button at the bottom](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-the-Add-Drip-Email-Options/). In the window that appears, add the Drip Email details and click the Add button.

Once added, you’ll see a blue [Add] link in the Emails column. Click this to open up another window in order to create an email for that Drip Campaign.

**Email Name:** This is the name of the email and different from the Subject line of the email. This allows you and staff to know what this email is for and about.

**Days into Campaign:** This lets you determine how many days into the Drip Campaign you’d like this email sent out.

For example, if it’s the first email of this particular Drip Campaign, you’d enter in 1. For the second email, you can choose how many days after that first email you’d like to send it, whether that’s 2 days into the campaign (1 day after the first email), 3 days into the campaign (2 days after the first email), and so on. For every Drip Email you have in the Drip Campaign, you can stagger them so they go out over a set period of time.

**Time of Day:** If you have a preference as to when people receive the email, use this field to choose that time.

Please note that the times chosen for Drip Email are Pacific time zone. Be sure to account for this when choosing the time for the emails to automatically be sent.

**Record As:** In ISP are many Communication Types. Use this to add a Communication to the recipients record when the email is sent.

**Subject:** This is the email subject line which recipients will see and know it’s from you.

**Body:** Create the text of your email here. You also have Merge Field options, which will automatically pull certain information, such as Name or other contact info, to the email when it is sent.

**Send As User:** With this box checked, the staff user that set the Drip Email option within the entity’s record will be shown as the sender. With it unchecked, the email will show the full campaign name (e.g. Washington for President).

**Reply To User:** With this box checked, the staff user that set the Drip Email option within the entity’s record will receive replies to the Drip Email. With it unchecked, the reply will go to the campaign’s standard email inbox instead of the staff member that set it in the entity’s record.

Once you’ve created your Drip Email, click the Add Drip Campaign Email button, or click Add & New to add that email and create a new Drip Email.

When emails are set to go out, the creator of the Drip Emails will receive a Pre-Drip email to inform of them of which emails are scheduled to be sent and who the recipients will be. This Pre-Drip email will be sent for each Drip Email created.
