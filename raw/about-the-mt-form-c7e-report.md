 About the MT Form C7E Report
==========

Applies To: Montana

The MT Form C-7E Report allows you to see if you have made any Electioneering Communications that are required to be filed with the state within 2 business days. You must file these expenditures with the state’s [Campaign Electronic Reporting System](https://cers-ext.mt.gov/CampaignTracker/dashboard).

However, CERS does not currently support reporting pre-election Expenditures through the upload function. You must re-enter the Qualifying Expenditures manually to CERS.
