 Why Can’t I See the FEC Form 3P?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission – Candidate Committees

If you are a Form 3P filer and can’t see the Form 3P as an available report in the dropdown, there are some additional data entry steps you’ll need to take.

First, ensure your [Committee and Candidate](https://ispolitical.com/what-records-are-needed-for-compliance-reporting/) records are set up.

### On the Candidate Record ###

* You must set Office Sought (or Office Held) to: US President.
* Set Office Sought Jurisdiction to: Federal.

### On the Committee Record ###

* Set the Committee Info Type: Candidate and Jurisdiction: Federal.

These additional steps ensure you are shown the correct report, either the Form 3 for House/Senate Candidates or the Form 3P for Presidential Candidates.
