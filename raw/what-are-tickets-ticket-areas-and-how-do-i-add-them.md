 What Are Tickets & Ticket Areas and How Do I Add Them?
==========

The Tickets tool gives you the ability to track and record any issues expressed to you by individuals and organizations. You can assign tickets to other staff users, as well as group similar ticket issues together.

Under the Tools tab, select Tickets. If you don’t see it as an option, select Add/Remove Tools, then scroll down to the Tickets option and click it to add it to your database.

If this is your first time using Tickets, you’ll first need to create a Ticket Area. These are required when creating Tickets.

How do I add a Ticket Area?
----------

On the main Tickets page, click the blue Ticket Areas button at the bottom of the screen. To add a Ticket Area, click the Add Ticket Area at the bottom of the screen. A window will appear and a Ticket Area Name field will appear. Add the name and click Add Ticket Area.

On the Ticket Areas page you’ll see three tabs: Active, Inactive, and All. These will show which Ticket Areas are still in use and active, which Ticket Areas have been moved to inactive, or a full display of all active and inactive Ticket Areas. 

To delete a Ticket Area click the red X to the left of the Ticket Area Name. If that Ticket Area is already in use, it will be moved to Inactive.

Once you’ve added the Ticket Area you’d like to use for Tickets, click the blue Manage Tickets button at the bottom of the page. This will return you back to the main Tickets page.

When you land on the Tickets page, you’ll see five tabs.

**Mine: Open:** This will show any Tickets you have assigned to you that are still open and pending.

**Unassigned: Open:** These are Tickets that are still open but yet to be assigned to any staff database users.

**All Open:** This is where all open Tickets regardless of status will be.

**Mine: Open & Closed:** This allows you to see all open and closed Tickets that are or were assigned to you.

**All: Open & Closed:** This will show all Tickets that have been created in the database, both open and closed statuses.

To add a Ticket, click the Add Ticket button at the bottom of the screen. A window will appear and allow you to add Ticket details.

**Subject:** This is the name of the Ticket and/or a general idea of what the Ticket is about.

**Description:** Use this text field to describe the issue at hand. You have various text editing options, as well.

**Ticket Area:** This is a list of the Ticket Areas created previously and determine where the issue is.

**Entity:** This is the individual or organization that alerted you or the staff to the issue.

**Assigned To:** You can use this to assign the ticket to a particular staff member that uses ISP.

Once these fields and options have been filled out and selected, click the Add Ticket button to add the new Ticket, or the Add & New button to add the Ticket and clear out the fields to create a new Ticket.

What else can I do with the Ticket?
----------

If you click the name of the Ticket, you’ll arrive on a new screen. This will allow you to quickly update who it’s assigned to, what Ticket Area it’s in, as well as the description. 

To the right will be the Entity and basic details from their record. You can make edits to their record’s details, if needed.

At the bottom of the screen are various options.

**Close Ticket:** Click this to close the Ticket.

**Add Update:** If you’d like to add an update to the ticket, click this button. A new window will appear and contain a text field where you can add an update. That will then appear in the Updates section above and display both the update and the date of the update.

**Email:** To email the entity directly, use this option.

You can also click the blue button to navigate directly to the Entity’s record. 

To return to the list of Tickets, click the List button at the bottom of the screen.
