 How Do I Capture Video With Windows 10?
==========

Sometimes it’s helpful for Support and other staff to see visually with video what issue you’re encountering. If you are **Windows 10** user, you already have a video capture tool built in to your system. Here’s how you can access and use it to send us video of the error or problem you’re encountering.

*Please be aware there may be slight variations on different versions of Windows.*

To begin, press the **Windows** key and the **letter G** at the same time. The background will darken some and several sections will appear.

Locate the section labeled **Capture**. If you do not see this section, click the **Widget Menu** at the top (second option from the left) and click **Capture**.

In the **Capture** section you’ll see several options denoted by icon. The camera is for taking a screen shot but what we’re looking for in the video capture is the **small circle recording button**.

If you’d like audio in your video, just to the right of the audio record button is a microphone icon. If there is a line through it, no audio will be captured in the video. Click it to remove the line and include audio in the video.

When you’re ready to begin, click the audio record button. A section will then appear on the right called **Capture Status**, and a timer will start counting. At this point, back in your database, take the steps you were taking previously when you encountered your issue.

When you finish, in the **Capture Status** section, click the **blue circle with white square** in it to end the video capture. To view the video, back in the **Capture** section, click the ***“Show all captures”***  option. A new section will appear and show you a gallery of all the videos you’ve captured, including the one you just recorded.

In that window you can rename it by clicking the pencil icon, as well as open the file location on your computer or simply delete it if you’re not happy with it and want to try again.
