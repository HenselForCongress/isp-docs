 About the NC Form 4100 Report
==========

Applies To: North Carolina

The NC 4100 Form is for Federal Committees to report expenditures in North Carolina. Expenditures include contributions to NC committees and independent expenditures that support or oppose candidates and ballot measures.

If $5,000 of contributions is to statewide candidates, or more than $10,000 to non-statewide candidates for an election cycle, you will need to file a 4100.

If no contributions are made during the reporting period, a report will need to be submitted regardless of any activity. 

This is a paper-only form. You must print the PDF, sign it, date it, and submit it to the State of North Carolina.
