 What Are the Sort Order Options for Compliance Reports?
==========

Sort Order is a cosmetic option for how transactions are organized on most reports. It can be helpful to review your data in a specific order on a PDF report, but it is not a requirement for most agencies.

If you have conduits or multiple splits on transactions, you may find the (split with whole) options below more helpful with reviewing. Some wholes and splits must appear in particular sections of a report and these Sort Order options will not change any requirement necessary for filing.

Sort Order Options
----------

**Alphabetical**: This will sort transactions based on Entity name.

**Date**: This will sorts transactions based on the date of the transaction.

**Alphabetical (splits with wholes)**: With Alphabetical (Split with Whole), the whole follows the standard alphabetical sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same name, the splits further itemize by date order. If there is more than one split with the same name AND date, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Date (splits with wholes)**: With Date (Split with Whole), the whole follows the standard date sort. The splits itemize immediately after the whole transaction, also in date order. If there is more than one split with the same date, the splits further itemize by alphabetical order. If there is more than one split with the same date AND name, the splits further itemize by amount (lowest to highest).

**Random**: This sorts transactions in a random pattern.
