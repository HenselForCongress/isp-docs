 What Are Flags and How Do I Use Them?
==========

Flags give you more control over how to separate, record, and keep track of how an individual or an organization is helping with the campaign. For example, if an entity is a Volunteer for the campaign, you can add the Volunteer Flag to their record.

Adding a Flag can be done by navigating to the record that you want to add the Flag to. In the Flags section header, click on the green triangle on its right side. In the Add Flags window, click in the Flag field. From the drop-down menu, click on the desired flag name; you may simultaneously add multiple Flags. Once the Flag has been selected, click on the green Add Flags button. You will now see the Flag in the record. Deleting a Flag is even simpler than adding one. Once you delete a Flag, it will be removed from all records; if that Flag is in use, then it will become Inactive. To delete a Flag or make a Flag Inactive, you just need to click on the red X.

You can search by Flags in Advanced Search to gather a list of records based on a particular Flag. This generated list can then be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for your convenience.

Flags are customizable with images. They can be decided from the pre-loaded images, or you can choose to leave them blank. The image will appear on the record of the entity.
