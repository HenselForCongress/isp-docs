|        Type         | Cash Impact| Net Worth Impact|                                                                                                                                     Description                                                                                                                                     |

|   Accrued Expense   |     No     |       Yes       |                                           Accrued expenses don’t impact your cash balance because they haven’t been paid yet. When paid, it impacts your cash balance as an accrued expense payment. Accrued expenses are a type of debt.                                           |
|   Accrued Income    |     No     |       Yes       |         Accrued Income is when incoming money is expected but not yet received. For example, an invoice is sent and the other entity agrees to pay the invoice but hasn’t yet. When the money is received, the payment is created as an Accrued Income Payment transaction.         |
| Allocation Transfer |    Yes     |       Yes       |This is a transfer between associated State and Federal committees. It assists with handling federal regulations related to allocating contributions and expenses between State and Federal funds. Use Internal Transfers for transfers between different accounts of the same filer.|

|In-Kind Contribution |     No     |       No        |                                                                                                       Transactions that are considered a gift of something rather than money.                                                                                                       |
|  Internal Transfer  |     No     |       No        |                 Internal Transfers allow you to move funds between accounts.

Sometimes referred to as Other Receipts.                                                                               |

###  Cash Impact  ###

Transactions with a cash impact will impact the amount of available funds, either in your bank account or in undeposited funds. You can see cash impact using financial reports such as either the Cash Flow or the Register report.

### Net Worth Impact ###

Most simple transactions have the same cash and net worth impact. However, for more complex accrual/debt-related transactions, the cash and net worth impact may differ. For example, a loan received will increase your cash, but since the money is still owed, it does not change your net worth.

You can see your current net worth by running the Net Worth report.
