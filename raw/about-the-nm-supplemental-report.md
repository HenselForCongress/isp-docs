 About the NM Supplemental Report
==========

Applies To: New Mexico

Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is received after 5:00 p.m. on the Tuesday before the election shall be reported to the secretary of state either in a supplemental report on a prescribed form within twenty-four hours of receipt OR in the report to be filed no later than the Thursday before a primary, general or statewide special election, except that any such contribution or pledge to contribute that is received after 5:00 p.m. on the Friday before the election may be reported by 12:00 noon on the Monday before the election.

The Supplemental Report has two versions:

* **Non-Statewide:** Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is for more than $1,000 in a non-statewide election shall be reported to the secretary of state. This version is set at the $1000 limit for contributions for Non-Statewide Elections.
* **Statewide:** Any contribution or pledge to contribute that is more than $3,000 in a statewide election shall be reported to the secretary of state. This version is set at the $3000 limit for contributions for Statewide Elections.

When setting the dates, use the date of the Tuesday before the election as the Start Date. 

To file your report, download the generated file and upload it by logging in to the [New Mexico Campaign Finance System](https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index). 

After you’ve filed, be sure to mark filed reports as Filed to ensure transactions do not report twice.

Compliance notes for Monetary Contributions are just reported as Monetary Contribution by default but will pull from the Compliance Note field if any note exists.
