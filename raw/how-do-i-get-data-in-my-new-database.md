 How Do I Get Data in My New Database?
==========

When you open an account with ISP, the database is an empty slate with no data. However, in order to effectively use the system as it was designed, filling it with data is an important first step.  

We perform all initial data imports for free, either five files in a standard format such as Excel, or a full export from another financial compliance product. Please note that some free and low-dollar accounts do not include free imports. If you have any questions, please contact your sales representative.

After you send the data you’d like imported, you can expect a turnaround time of one business week. However, in rare cases, it can take longer.

To get started, send the files to support@ispolitical.com.  

If you need more import options, check out the [Quick Import tool](https://ispolitical.com/quick-import-tool/) under the Tools tab.

If you need to do a regular import that doesn’t appear to be available, such as from your online donation processor, talk to us about integrations and custom import formats.
