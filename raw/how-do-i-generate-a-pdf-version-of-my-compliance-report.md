 How Do I Generate a PDF Version of My Compliance Report?
==========

After you generate your compliance report, we recommend downloading the report as a PDF so that you have it for your records. This allows you the ability to both view the report at that moment and compare it to previous reports for discrepancies. Downloading the PDF version also allows you to view the report in the future without having to regenerate it.

Once the report is generated, click the Download button at the bottom of the screen and select PDF. If this is not done upon generation, you will later need to regenerate the report to download the PDF. You can also select Save to File Later via the Filing button, which will allow you to save the report as a PDF as well.
