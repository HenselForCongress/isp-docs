 About the FEC Form 24-IE Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC 24-IE is only filed by political committees. For Non-Committee filers, use the [Form 5](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-5-report/).   

The FEC 24-IE Report is used to report Independent Expenditures of more than $1,000 within the 20 days before an election. Independent Expenditures made by the committee and the estimated expenses will pull to this report. 

Please note Schedule E only discloses Federal candidate or committee info.

If you need to file a report due to an IE over $10,000 at any time outside of the 20 days before an election, please use the [FEC Form 48-IE Report](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-48-ie/).
