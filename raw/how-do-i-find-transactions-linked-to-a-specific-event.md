 How Do I Find Transactions Linked to a Specific Event?
==========

Some transactions in your database may be linked to Events. On the Transactions report, you can narrow down your results based on that specific event. This report is found under the Reports tab, then selecting Financial.

In the Events criteria field, click into the field and without typing anything, a list of all Events in your database will show. If your list is long, begin typing the name of the Event to narrow it down. Click the name of the Event to add it to the report criteria.

Once you’ve completed any remaining desired fields, click the Generate button at the bottom to view the report results on the screen. You also have an option to Print or Export the results.

If this will be a report you think you’ll be generating on a regular basis, click the Save Report button to save this criteria for future use.
