 About Generating and Filing Compliance Reports
==========

Where do I find Compliance reports in ISP?
----------

Under the Reports tab is a Compliance option. You’ll be taken to a report criteria screen when you select that. However, if the database was only recently set up, you may need to first [set the Filer](https://ispolitical.com/What-Records-are-Needed-for-Compliance-Reporting/). The Filer is your committee record in ISP and is then added as the Filer. Doing so informs the system of which Compliance reports your committee will be filing.

The criteria screen will determine the data that pulls to your Compliance report. It’s essential to make sure you are using the correct criteria, whether it’s the Report Dates or Previous Unitemized Individual Donations amount. The wrong information will again create mistakes that will prompt notice from the filing agency.

When you are satisfied with the criteria, click the Generate button. Messages at the top of the screen inform you of the report process status. When it finishes, you’ll land on a screen displaying either a message that no warnings and errors were found OR a list of warnings or errors you’ll need to correct before filing your report. Click the error or warning to display the area that needs correcting on the right side of the screen. 

After you have corrected any issues, be sure to regenerate your report. This will allow your changes to be displayed correctly on the report.

To review the report, click the Download button at the bottom of the screen after the report is generated and select PDF. You can download the report anywhere on your computer and review it for any issues or concerns.

How do I e-file the Compliance report?
----------

After reviewing your report and being ready to e-file it, click the E-File Report button at the bottom of the screen. You’ll then have a field to enter in a password. Each filing agency has its password process so in some cases, depending on the agency, you’ll see multiple fields. These passwords and tokens are provided to you by your filing agency. 

In ISP is a safeguard for your passwords. Click the Save to Password Safe checkbox and save your password for future filings. If the password changes, you can edit the password the next time you e-file a report.

It’s important to note not all filing agencies support e-filing. If you have any questions or concerns with this, please contact Support.
