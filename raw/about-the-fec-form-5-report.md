 About the FEC Form 5 Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The Form 5 is only filed by Non-Committee filers. For Political Committee filers, use the [Form 24-IE](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-24-ie-report/) or the [Form 48-IE](https://ispolitical.com/about-the-fec-form-48-ie-report/).

The FEC Form 5 Report is for reporting independent expenditures made and contributions received to be used by persons other than political committees. Independent expenditures aggregating in excess of $250 in a calendar year must report on this report. In order for these reports to work, both Expenses and Estimated Expenses need Support/Oppose Memos with either IE to Support or IE to Oppose.

Note that if a transaction has been reported on a Form 3/3x that has been marked as filed, that transaction will not pull to a Form 5.
