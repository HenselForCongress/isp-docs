 How Do I Add & Use Genders?
==========

Use the Genders option if you want to specify genders in the greetings of emails or letters sent to individuals.

To get started, click the Add Gender button at the bottom of the page. In the window that opens, simply type in the gender you’d like to add to the system, then click the Add button. 

On the main page, you can click the gender name to edit it or click the red X to the left to delete it. If the gender is in use with an existing record, it will be made Inactive and you will not see it as an option when adding genders to records.
