 How Do I Record a Deposit?
==========

Recording deposits is an important step in making sure incoming donations reflect just how they were deposited in your committee’s bank accounts outside of ISP. You can access the Record Deposit screen one of two ways, either the Record Deposit option in the Accounting tab or by clicking Undeposited Funds from the bottom of the Register screen.

When you arrive on the Deposit screen, you’ll see two sections: Deposit Summary and Deposit Transactions.

**Deposit Summary:** The Deposit Summary section contains details about the deposit you are creating. This includes Amount, which will adjust as you select or deselect transactions below, and Date of the deposit, which is the date the funds were deposited into your actual bank account.

The Deposit Number and Deposit Name fields are optional but in those fields you can add information that will allow you to track your deposits. These data points are searchable by other lists and reports throughout the system. 

The Financial Account drop down will show all active Financial Accounts you have in the database.

**Deposit Transactions:** In the Deposit Transactions section you can select transactions to create a batch deposit. To select transactions, click the check box to the left of the transaction. 

In the top left corner of the section, you’ll see a checkbox to the left of the Number column header. This allows you to select or deselect all of the transactions at once.

At the bottom of the screen is a dropup menu labeled Record. This contains various deposit recording options:

* **Record Deposit:** This will complete the process of creating the deposit.
* **Record Deposit & New:** This will create a deposit of the transactions you selected, then clear out the fields to create a new deposit.
* If you have the WinRed or ActBlue integration set up, you’ll also see a Record ActBlue Conduit Check or Record WinRed Conduit Check button. If you received a check from ActBlue or WinRed that comprises donations that came in through this conduit, you can create a specific deposit for those transactions to ensure reporting accuracy.

The Related Pages menu allows you to navigate to various helpful page: Balances, Non-Monetary Contributions, and the Register.

Use the print option to print the deposit screen to a PDF.
