 Why Are Transactions Not Itemized on FEC Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When generating FEC reports, some transactions may not be showing up on your report as itemized entries. One of the more likely possibilities is that the transaction didn’t reach the FEC itemization threshold.

Per FEC guidelines, transactions must be itemized if it exceeds $200.00. Therefore, on ISP, a transaction at exactly $200.00 will not be itemized and will instead pull to the Unitemized line on the report (Line 11aii). Any transactions at $200.01 or above will still be itemized, however.

If the unitemized transaction is passed the threshold of $200.01 or if you still have a problem with transactions not itemizing, contact Support at [Support@ISPolitical.com](mailto:support@ispolitical.com) with the exact details.
