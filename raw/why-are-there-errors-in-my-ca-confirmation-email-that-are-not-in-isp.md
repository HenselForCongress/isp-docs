 Why Are There Errors in My CA Confirmation Email That Are Not in ISP?
==========

Applies To: California

In confirmation emails received from the state after filing your CA 460, sometimes warnings will be included that were not listed in the ISP system. This is because in most cases, those warnings do not apply to your committee.

Know that when it comes to the CA filing system, it’s well over 20 years old. In dog years, that’s at least 140 years old. Due to this, the error checking system isn’t as savvy as it could be.

Not all compliance report errors and warnings are the same. In fact, some of them can be very difficult to discern. Below are some things to keep in mind or attempt if you receive an error or warning you are unsure about.

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not a candidate committee:**

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s last name is missing. Field: 49

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s first name is missing. Field: 50

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s address is missing. Field: 53

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s city is missing. Field: 55

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s state is missing. Field: 56

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Candidate/Officeholder’s zip is missing. Field: 57

These warnings are asking for name & contact information of the candidate associated with the committee’s. However, if your committee does not have a candidate, this would not apply. The ISP system is able to recognize this and will not list the warnings.

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is not primarily-formed to support/oppose a specific candidate or measure:**

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Support/Oppose is missing. Field: 70

**The following error messages can be ignored if the filer is a candidate-controlled committee:**

This is a warning for line: 2  
Form/Schedule: F460 Record Type: CVR  
Filer data missing from cover page.  
Refer to the CAL format version 2.01 for details or call your vendor.

This warning is looking for an individual name – the validator thinks the actual candidate is filing the report rather than the candidate committee.
