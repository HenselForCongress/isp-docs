 What Is Rocket Management?
==========

Rocket is an installable Android app that allows you to manage your ISP call time queue, track progress, and follow up with donors and constituents. It’s ideal for candidates, fundraisers, and other campaign staff who want to go through a call list on their phones or away from a computer.

The Rocket App is based on Reminders added to records in ISP. Any record with a Reminder assigned to you with a date matching the current day or older will be available. As you go through each contact that appears on your phone, you’ll have the option to add a note with the result of that call, indicate a pledge amount, and set up a follow-up reminder, if necessary. These actions can be done directly from the Rocket App and appear automatically on the matching record in ISP.

How Do I Turn On and Set up the Rocket App?
----------

To use the app with the [Call Time](https://ispolitical.com/what-is-call-time-and-how-do-i-use-it/) or [Reminder](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-reminders/) functionality in ISP, navigate to the Tools tab and select Add/Remove Tools, then scroll to the Rocket Management listing. Click it to begin the installation process. Once installed, it will show as a new menu option under the Tools tab.

From the Rocket Management page, click Generate Token to get started. This will send a text to the phone number associated with your user account in ISP. The text message will contain a link to download and install the app on your Android phone. You will likely get a few warnings about setting changes and permissions. That is an expected security function of Android. Be sure to make any needed changes indicated by your Android phone to allow the app to be installed and function as intended.

Once the app is installed, it will ask for an authorization token. This is the token you generated on the Rocket Management page in ISP. The token shown will disappear when it has expired after 10 minutes. If that time lapses, click Generate New Token to show a new token for use in authorizing the Rocket app.
