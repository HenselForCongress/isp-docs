Applies To: Missouri

The MO Late Contributions Report is used to report the receipt of any late contribution or loan that exceeds $250 and has been received within 11 days of the election.

Paper forms are available on the MEC’s website and can be mailed or hand-delivered. If you decide to fax or email your filings, then you will need to confirm with MEC that the statement was received and filed. In order to file your report through MEC is by importing your data from a .csv file. Log in to the [MEC Campaign Finance Reporting System](https://mec.mo.gov/CampaignFinance/Entry/LogOn_01.aspx?) to e-file your report.
