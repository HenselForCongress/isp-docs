 How Do I Report Inkind Transactions Paid by the Candidate?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When a candidate makes an In-kind transaction to a separate entity, correct data entry is important to ensure data pulls to the right locations on your compliance report.

In the Entity field when adding the transaction, use the candidate that made the In-kind transaction. Then, in the Splits section of the transaction, add the recipient of the In-kind transaction.

On the report, the transaction should appear on Line 11(d) as a receipt from the candidate AND on Line 17 as a disbursement to the vendor/recipient. These transactions will be marked as In-kind on the report.
