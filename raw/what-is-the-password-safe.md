 What Is the Password Safe?
==========

The security of passwords is very important no matter what the password is used for. In ISP, we have created Password Safe, a place where in the system your filing password is kept protected and ready for use the next time you need to file a report.

After you have generated your report and are ready to file, click the Efile button. On the resulting page will either be fields to add your password and an option to add it to the Password Safe, or, if Password Safe has been used in the past, you’ll see a message stating Password Safe is in use.

If you have used Password Safe in the past but need to change the password in Password Safe, generate the report as normal and again click Efile. On the resulting screen, you’ll see a Change Password link. Click this to update to the new password for future use.
