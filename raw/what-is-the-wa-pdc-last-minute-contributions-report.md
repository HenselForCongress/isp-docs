 What Is the WA PDC Last Minute Contributions Report?
==========

Applies To: Washington

The WA PDC Last Minute Contributions report is to be used by Candidate and Candidate Committees who have received Monetary Contributions or Inkind Contributions totaling $1500 that are seven days before the Primary or 21 days before the General.

This report discloses:

* the amount of the contributions
* the date or date received
* the name and address of the donor
* the receiving campaigns name and address

This form must be filed through the state and can be done by either delivering a written report within 48 hours of receiving the Contribution to the PDC or filing on the agency’s [website](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/registration-reporting/candidates-committees/contributions/special-limits-and-reports-last-minute-contributions). 

Candidates and committees receiving one or more contributions from a single source totaling $1,500 or more must deliver a written report to the PDC within 48 hours of receiving the contribution, or the first working day thereafter, if the 48th hour falls on a weekend or holiday.

Either file the C-3 within 48 hours or file a special [Last Minute Contribution (LMC)](https://dev-pdc-pdc.pantheonsite.io/registration-reporting/forms-reports-directory#LMC) report. Political committees – including PACs, parties and caucus committees- that give these contributions file special reports within 24 hours of giving. Any contributions disclosed on an LMC report should also be reported on the appropriate C-3 and C-4 reports.
