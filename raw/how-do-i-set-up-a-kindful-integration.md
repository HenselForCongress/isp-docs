 How Do I Set up a Kindful Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

Adding a Kindful integration has specific steps to take in order to ensure contributions are synced correctly.

Navigate to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove. Scroll until you see the Kindful integration in the Available section, then click it to add it. You’ll then be directed to the Kindful login page. Once you log in to your Kindful account, you’ll be redirected back to ISP where Kindful will now be included as an integration.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a Kindful organization record in the account with Kindful’s details.

Back in your Kindful account, when you set up a fund, there is a specific format you will need to use to make sure the data can be mapped correctly in ISP.

If this format isn’t followed the data will not sync:

Fund Name = Filer: ElectionName

Examples:

Fund Name = Zach Morris for Prez: G-2020

Fund Name = ZachPAC: Non-Election

Fund Name = MorrisCares PAC: O-1950

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Kindful via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Kindful will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.
