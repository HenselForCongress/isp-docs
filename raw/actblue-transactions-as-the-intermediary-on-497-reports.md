 ActBlue Transactions as the Intermediary on 497 Reports
==========

Applies To: California

When transactions are received via the [ActBlue integration](https://ispolitical.com/how-do-i-set-up-an-actblue-integration/) and need to be filed on the CA 497 24 Hour Report, the data entry must be correct in order for them to appear as they are required on the CA Form 497 report.

In the ActBlue transaction, locate the Tags menu and choose Conduit-Conduit Check.

Using this tag will pull the ActBlue transaction to the correct location on the 497 report and will also include an additional note that the transaction was received via a Conduit.
