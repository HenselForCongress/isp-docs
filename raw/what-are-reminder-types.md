 What Are Reminder Types?
==========

Reminder Types allows you to make Reminders in your database easier to use, categorize, and sort. It will allow you to differentiate between the different reasons you would need to use Reminders.

First, if you don’t have the standard Reminders tool installed, install the Tool from the Tools menu. Select the Add/Remove option, then on the resulting screen, scroll through the available options or type Reminders into the Search field.

Once the tool is installed, you’ll see Reminder Types in the Lists menu. On that page, you can create different Reminder Types to properly denote what the Reminders are for. These Reminder Types will be available to select when setting the Reminder on the entity record.
