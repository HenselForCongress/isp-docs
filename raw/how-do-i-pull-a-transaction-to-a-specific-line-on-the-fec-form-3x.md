### FEC Form 3X: Line by Line Breakdown ###

Below is a breakdown of each Receipt and Disbursement line on Form 3X. If you want to pull a specific transaction to a particular spot or know how transactions pull to the FEC Form 3X, you will find that information below.

NOTE: If your account is set up to support Carey funds and you need to ensure these report correctly on Line 17 instead of 11a, ensure the contributions are deposited into accounts associated with the filer marked as Carey. Regardless of entity type, any contribution will pull to Line 17 if the above steps are taken. Also, be aware the text Non Contribution Account is automatically added to transactions associated with your Carey account.

2. The original Accrued Expense is still disclosed on Sch D.

When there is a payment on the Accrued Expense:

1. We disclose the payment to the original entity on Sch E. We removed the Support/Oppose information from this transaction and added the memo text “Debt Payment. See additional transactions for Independent Expenditure details.”
2. We disclose the Independent Expenditure information as a memo. We pull the Accrued Expense Payment date (not the original Accrued Expense date) as the payment date.
