 What Is the Calendar and Recurring Calendar Entries?
==========

The Calendar in ISP allows you to schedule important dates and events, including linking any staff members involved.

When viewing the Calendar, you have different displays to choose from. You can view in the traditional calendar boxed view, or use the list view to see the events in a list fashion. Select your preferred view with the Month/List buttons in the top right corner. You can also scroll through the months or yearly list with the arrows in the top left corner.

The Calendar works in conjunction with [Calendar Feeds](https://ispolitical.com/What-Are-Calendar-Feeds/) and allows you to automatically have calendar events show up on your personal Google or Outlook calendar.

What are recurring calendar entries?
----------

On the Calendar view page, you can add calendar entries, whether they’re single one-off events or if they’re recurring events. If you have events that happen frequently on a recurring schedule, such as weekly meetings, paydays, or birthdays, you can create events that happen on a recurring basis so you don’t have to repeatedly add them to the calendar.

You have two options to add recurring calendar entries, either by the Add Recurring Entry button or the associated page that displays a list view of recurring calendar entries. Click the Recurring Calendar Entries button to navigate to that page.

When you add a recurring calendar entry, you’ll have multiple options for scheduling and assigning the calendar event.

In the window that opens, the top section labeled First Event is where you’ll set up the main details of the event, including the Type and Description. Use the Start and End Date fields to set when the event starts. Select All Day if it’s an all day event or set the time frame the event will run from. You can also specify who sees the event in the calendar, whether it’s a certain user or group of users or if it’s all users in the database.

The second section, Recurring Rules, allows you to set the specific recurring details of the event.

The Frequency option lets you determine if the event is a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual event. For monthly and yearly events, depending on the specific Start Date, you’ll also be able to determine whether the recurring event happens on that specific day of the month or any other relative date related to when it falls in the month.

Monthly and Yearly options also provide more advanced options, such as weekend handling. If the event will happen on a weekend, you can choose the following options:

* **Allow Weekends:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, it will remain on that day on the calendar.
* **Skip Weekends:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, the event will not be scheduled for that month. 
* **Closest Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a weekend, the event will be listed on either Friday or Monday, depending on if the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday.
* **Next Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday, the event will be listed on the following Monday.
* **Previous Weekday:** If the day of the event lands on a Saturday or Sunday, the event will fall on the Friday before.
