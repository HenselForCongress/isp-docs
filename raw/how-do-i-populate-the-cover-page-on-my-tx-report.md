 How Do I Populate the Cover Page on My TX Report?
==========

Applies To: Texas

**How do I get Supported Candidate info to pull to the cover page of the report?**

This information has to be entered manually post e-file upload. We include that part there so it gets pulled to the PDF for tracking purposes.

**How do I pull committee activity to Section 14 on Cover page 2?**

In order to ensure Section 14 of Cover Page 2 pulls with Support/Oppose memo activity, be sure any Candidate, Officeholder, or Ballot Measure supported has been added as a Relationship to the filer.

Relationships that will pull include Ballot Measure Supported, Ballot Measure Opposed, Supported Candidate, Opposed Candidate, Officeholder Assisted.

Also note that this section is not currently supported on the e-file upload and will need to be entered manually on your online report.
