 How Do I Correct Disallowed Reporting Description Warnings Or Provide Accurate Compliance Notes on Reports?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

When it comes to Disbursements on reports, the Reporting Description is required. This information is added to the Compliance Note field within the transaction.

If you receive a Disallowed Reporting Description warning after generating a report, click the warning to display the transaction on the right hand side of the screen. In the Compliance Note field, add the appropriate Reporting Description, then save the change.

 Please note that in order for the warning to not be thrown after the update, you’ll need to regenerate the report.

If you’re unsure what is an allowable Reporting Description, visit the [FEC’s site to view the various options](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/purposes-disbursements/) you have available to you.
