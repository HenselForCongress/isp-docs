 What Are Webhooks and How Do I Use Them?
==========

Webhooks is an advanced Tools feature. Please only use webhooks if you are familiar with developing or have an experienced developer working with you.

Webhooks can be used to send information to another system. For example, a specialized email system or for updating a total raised ticker on your website.

With webhooks, whenever a donation is added to ISP, it and information about the donor will be automatically transmitted to your specified endpoint. Data that gets transmitted over contains both donation info and also basic donor contact info, such as addresses, phones, and emails.

All Monetary Contributions, regardless of how they were added to ISP, will be sent to the endpoint.

You also have the option of getting information sent to an endpoint whenever a contribution is edited or deleted.

You can have different endpoints for each one of these calls.

Data is sent via JSON and will be sent to your designated endpoint in near real time.
