 About the MA Deposit Report
==========

Applies To: Massachusetts

The MA Deposit Report Form is for all Contributions with any receipt in excess of $50. However, any contributor of $50 or less must be itemized if the aggregate contribution for the calendar year has exceeded $50. Select the deposit you want to report from the Deposit Transaction drop-down. You will need to generate a new report for every deposit.

This report does not support Conduit reporting. Contributions from conduits should not be entered as splits of a conduit. To file, download the generated deposit report and log into the state’s [Campaign Finance System](https://ocpf.us/).
