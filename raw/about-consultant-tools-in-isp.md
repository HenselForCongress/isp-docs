 About Consultant Tools in ISP
==========

Some ISP users are considered Consultants. This means they work across multiple accounts they have access to. 

If you are a Consultant, at the bottom right of each screen is a dropup menu labeled Consultant Tools. Clicking this opens up a list of various pages you can access. Each page will allow you to perform various tasks, some in bulk across your accounts.
