 What Are Time Tracking Categories?
==========

Time Tracking Categories are a way for you to help keep the various ways you are tracking staff and/or volunteer hours. For example, if you have a volunteer going door to door and you want to keep track of the date and times the volunteer was out in the area, you can create a Door to Door category for that purpose.

After Time Tracking Categories have been added, they’ll be available for use in the [Time Tracking](https://ispolitical.com/What-Is-Time-Tracking/?refresh=30783) section of the staff or volunteer’s individual record in the database.
