The MI PAC Bulk form is used to file Pre-Election, Post-Election, Annuals, Dissolution, Quarterly, and amended campaign statements. This will generate a file that you must then upload to the state’s MERTS system. To file your report, you must first download the MERTS PAC Module.

 Login into your [state account](https://mertsplus.com/software.html) to download the MERTS PAC and e-file with MERTS.
