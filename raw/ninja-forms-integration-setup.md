 Ninja Forms Integration Setup
==========

Ninja Form s is a new Integration we have made available to all ISP  
 clients. While it is not meant to be used for donations, it is quite  
adept at creating forms for things like Volunteer signup,.

To  
 install, go to Integrations, Add/Remove Integrations. It will be  
listed. Once the installation is completed, You will need to view the  
Integration (under the menu of the same name) to get the Account Name  
and API key so you can complete the setup inside your [Ninja Forms Account](https://ninjaforms.com/docs/webhooks/).
