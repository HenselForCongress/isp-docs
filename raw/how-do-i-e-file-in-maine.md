 How Do I E-file IN Maine?
==========

Applies To: Maine

After generating your report in ISP, click Download to retrieve your file. The downloaded efile is formatted as .xlsx. If you open the file with Excel, you will get a warning message at the top of the file. This is expected. Because ME has very specific Column Headers, we made some updates to ensure those Column Headers stayed intact.  

Even with this warning, you can still review your data by clicking on the tabs at the bottom. However, if you wish to update any of your data (which we do NOT recommend), click Enable Editing to edit your data.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT update any of the column headers, as changing these in any way will not allow your file to be uploaded.*

To efile your report, log in to your account on the [Maine Ethics Commission site](https://mainecampaignfinance.com/#/index).
