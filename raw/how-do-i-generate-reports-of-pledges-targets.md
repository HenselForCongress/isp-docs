 How Do I Generate Reports of Pledges & Targets?
==========

The Balances page allows you to view reports on various transactions that typically carry a debt or goal. If you have Pledges and Targets in your database, you can generate reports on each to find out which donors made a Pledge to donate in the future and for how much, as well as any Targets, or fundraising goals, you have set for certain entities. 

Pledges and Targets are [created and managed in entity records](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pledges-targets-and-how-do-i-add-them-to-records/), both Individuals and Organizations.
