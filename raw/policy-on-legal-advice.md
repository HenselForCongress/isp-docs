 Policy on Legal Advice
==========

When it comes to Compliance reporting, each filing agency comes with their own set of rules and guidelines. These can sometimes be complex. However, filing accurate compliance reports is very important. Because of this, we tend to shy away from providing legal advice when it comes to reports. In these instances, we highly recommend contacting your legal analyst or committee’s legal department for any legal matters you may encounter when preparing and/or generating your compliance report before filing.
