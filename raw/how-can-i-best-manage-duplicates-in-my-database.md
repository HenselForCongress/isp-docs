 How Can I Best Manage Duplicates in My Database?
==========

The potential for duplicate Individual and Organization records increases as your campaign progresses. Because of this, there are a couple of processes in ISP to help you manage duplicates.

ai@ISP
----------

One of many tasks [ai@ISP](https://ispolitical.com/What-Is-ai-ISP/) is charged with is combining duplicates while you handle other work. To turn on this feature, navigate to the ai@ISP page under the Tools tab. On the resulting page, slide the Auto-Combine Duplicates option to the right to turn it on.

When determining what is a duplicate, ai@ISP will not combine records if there is even a slight doubt they are not duplicates. ai@ISP will combine records only when there is a matching name and matching contact information. Only records that match will be combined overnight. All others will be left for you to manually combine.

Manual Combining
----------

To see the potential duplicates ai@ISP didn’t catch, or if you simply prefer to see which records are potential duplicates, navigate to the Combine Duplicates page under the Tools tab. To set the criteria for the system to search for duplicates, click the Change Method button at the bottom of the screen. In the Duplicate Search Methods window that appears, you’ll see multiple options in the Name Match field drop-down menu. These options allow you to be as strict or loose with the results as possible. 

The Name Match options will determine how ai@ISP uses the name fields to determine potential duplicates:

* **A+:** This looks at all the name fields, including name suffixes and prefixes. When used with other contact information, these are almost certainly duplicates.
* **A:** Similar to A+, when used with other contact information, these are almost certainly duplicates but may have problems in rare cases such as “Jr” & “Sr” living together.
* **B:** Simple name matching focusing on first and last names. Use carefully, especially without high-quality contact information matches.
* **C:** This uses a very wide net to find potential duplicates. While it is helpful for dealing with typos and other name variations, this will also have many false positives.

Start with A+ to get the most conservative results, then move through the rest and make your determinations as you move along. 

It’s also helpful to mark those that aren’t duplicates as Not Duplicates. You can then exclude them from future searches and results.

Note: In the event that you need to uncombine duplicates that were accidentally combined, you can do so by first navigating to the entity record. Once in the entity record, select Uncombine from the drop-up menu of the Advanced Tools button and then finalize the process in the Uncombine Entity window.
