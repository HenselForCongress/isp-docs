 Why Isn’t Candidate Information Pulling Properly to the FEC Form 3X?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

If your candidate information is not pulling properly to your Form 3x, confirm that information on the candidate’s individual record is filled out properly. Office Sought, State, Jurisdiction, and District Number all need to be properly filled out in order for the information to pull correctly to the report.
