 About the MI PAC LCR Report
==========

Applies To: Michigan

The MI PAC Late Contribution Report must be filed via the state’s software. This report provides a list of all contributors that meet the criteria, along with all pertinent information needed to enter into the state’s system.  

As a reminder, the criteria for filing an LCR is a single contribution or a cumulative contribution from the same contributor of $2500.00 or more after the closing date of the last campaign statement required and the 3rd day before an election.  

When creating the LCR, make sure to enter the from date as the day after the closing date of the last filed report. Make sure to click Mark as Filed after filing on the state’s system to ensure transactions are not included in the next report.

Login into your [state account](https://eidr.nictusa.com/login) to enter the data.
