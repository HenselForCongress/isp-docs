 How Do I Set Up My Compliance Reporting?
==========

Setting up your database for Compliance reporting is an essential first step in ISP. This involves setting up your Filer and creating your committee’s record with committee IDs and other committee information, creating Treasurer, Candidate (if applicable), and other staff records, then linking them correctly.

Your Filer and committee’s records allow the system to generate Compliance reports with the accurate committee and financial information.

Create the Records first. To start, set up staff and candidate records (individual), then add the committee record (organization) and link the other records using Relationships. Make sure to include all pertinent data. ISP pulls data from these records to put on your compliance reports.
