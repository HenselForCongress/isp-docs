A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for political campaigns is a software tool designed to help political organizations manage and streamline their interactions with supporters, donors, volunteers, and other stakeholders. The primary goal of a CRM for political campaigns is to raise more money in less time by enhancing communication, organizing data, and improving overall campaign efficiency.
