 What Is the Difference Between Actor and User Fields in Advanced Search?
==========

Depending on the Area you choose when in Advanced Search, you may see Field options for Actor and User. 

**Actor:** This field could either be a user or an integration. The Actor field includes non-users that would be touching your data, such as AI and integrations.

**User:** This field can only be accessed by a user on your account such as yourself, the Treasurer, etc.
