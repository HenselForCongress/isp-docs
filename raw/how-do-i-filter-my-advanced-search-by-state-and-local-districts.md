 How Do I Filter My Advanced Search by State and Local Districts?
==========

In Advanced Search you can filter by Congressional District but not by State Legislative Districts. Unfortunately, the shear number of different districts across the country and the lack of registry material identifying them makes supporting that search unfeasible.  

Advanced Search does, however, have some methods you can use to filter by State and Local Districts.

Method 1: Search by Distance
----------

The simplest method would be to search by Distance. 

* **Area:** Addresses
* **Field:** Distance 

In the pop-up, enter an address that is roughly in the middle of the district you are looking in. 

* **Relationship:** Is Less Than
* **Value:** Enter in the distance in miles 

The system will pull all addresses that are within that distance from the initial address you selected. Depending on the mile distance you chose, this can take longer than usual, so expect to wait a few minutes for results.  

This method will get you a very general filter and works best with rounder, more compact districts. 

Method 2: Search by City
----------

This method is much slower but a much more accurate method would be to create a search using each City in the district. This process involves different search groups.  

First, start with the City. 

* **Area:** Address
* **Field:** City
* **Relationship:** Is
* **Value:** (name of City)

Click Add Rule, then New Search Group. Make sure you hit New Search Group between each City you add as a rule. Similar to using Is Any Of as the Relationship, this will let the system search for results that match any one of the Search Groups rather than all of them.  

When you click Run Search, the system will locate all records that have an address in any of the cities you entered. If using cities is not accurate enough for what you need, you can also do this using Zip Codes.  

If you expect to run this specific search frequently, click Save & Run Search to save the search criteria for future report generation.
