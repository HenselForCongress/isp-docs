Please note that per the FEC Form 1 guidelines, the term Connected Organization means any organization which is not a political committee but which directly or indirectly establishes, administers, or financially supports a political committee. A connected organization may be a corporation (including a corporation without capital stock), a labor organization, a membership organization, a cooperative, or a trade association. Therefore, a Connected Organization will be considered a Parent Company.

* **Committee Connections:** This can be any kind of Connected Organization (aka Parent Company), Affiliated Committee, Joint Fundraising Representative, or Leadership PAC Sponsor. If any organization record has one of these links in their Relationships section, it will pull to this section of the Form 1 with the correct Relationship box automatically checked.
* **Custodian of Records:** This will pull the entity linked in the committee record’s Relationships section as the Record Keeper. The Address and Phone Number info is directly from the entity’s record in the system.
* **Treasurer Info:** This will pull the entity linked in the committee record’s Relationships section as the Treasurer. The Address and Phone Number info is directly from the entity’s record in the system.
