 Where Do I File as a Local CA Filer if the “Efile Report to Local” Button Is Not Available (ECampaign & Efs)?
==========

Applies To: California

Filing your Compliance reports with a Local CA Filing Agency (e.g. City of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara County, etc.) is possible via ISP. There are, however, certain data entry steps to take first.

### Filer/Committee Entity Record ###

First, under Committee Info, ensure Jurisdiction is set appropriately.

– If you need to file with your county, select County.  
– If you need to file with a city or town, select City.

In addition, ensure Jurisdiction is filled in with the City or County you are filing with. Examples of data entry possibilities are Orange, Orange County, or City of San Diego.

### Can I file locally with all cities and counties? ###

Short answer, no. If you are a local filer to one of the following local agencies, you cannot use the E-File Report to Local Agency button. There are other systems that can be used such as eCampaign or EFS. To file with these systems, you need to either download the .cal file from our system and upload to your local agency’s website (login page found below), or download the PDF, sign it, and file the paper copy.
