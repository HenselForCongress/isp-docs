 What Are MIA Donation Totals?
==========

MIA donations are our way of helping you find potentially missed donation opportunities. This data looks back at a person or organization’s historical donations, finds those who gave more in the past, and tells you the difference. This information can be then exported as a file for mailings, a call sheet, or other data viewing purposes.

You can find MIA Donation amounts in the Key Statistics on the Dashboard, in entity records, and Quick Imports.
