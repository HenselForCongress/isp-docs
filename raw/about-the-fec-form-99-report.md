 About the FEC Form 99 Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 99 Report is used by registered committees needing to submit a letter for the following reasons:

Version Differences
----------

* **Disavowal Response:** A letter where a candidate disavows unauthorized campaign activity within 30 days after being notified by the agency that another person or group has received contributions or made expenditures of more than $5,000 on the individual’s behalf.

* **Filing Freq. Change Notice:** Notification in writing where committees may change their filing schedule from quarterly to monthly (or vice versa). This can only be done once per calendar year.
* **Misc. Report to the FEC:** All other correspondence and FEC disclosures. This is the most commonly used version. A Miscellaneous Report may be used for narrative responses that do not affect actual entries within a report; for example, when outlining the committee’s procedures for making the best efforts to obtain contributor information.
