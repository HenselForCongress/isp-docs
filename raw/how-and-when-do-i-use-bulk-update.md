 How and When Do I Use Bulk Update?
==========

If you need to update transactions en masse, you can use the Bulk Update option. This option is available in the Financial Reports area using the Transactions Report. If you are editing a recorded deposit, you’ll have the same options (i.e., once you have recorded your deposit, click the Related Pages button at the bottom of the page).

*Please note that changing transactions in bulk can significantly impact compliance reports. Use extreme caution with this tool, and be sure these are the changes you want to make.*

Once you have generated your report, click the Actions button at the bottom of the page. Select Bulk Update from this button’s drop-up menu. On the Bulk Update Transactions page, click the orange Update button. Make your selection from this button’s drop-up menu (i.e., what you want to change), which includes

* **Budget Category:** Choose which Budget Category you want the transactions list to have.  

* **Date:** To change the date in bulk for your transactions, use the Update Date option.  

* **Election:** Select the Election from the drop-down list of active elections in your database to update the transactions to have the same election designation.
* **Event:** Add or Update multiple transactions with the Update Event option to include or edit Events tied to the transactions found in your report.
* **Financial Account:** If you need to move multiple transactions from one Financial Account to another in your database, use this option.  

* **Force Itemize:** Update transactions so they itemize on Compliance reports regardless of amount.
* **Notes:** In this window, you can select which note to update, whether it’s the Compliance Note, Check Note, or Internal Note. You can also update all the Note types at the same time.
* **Reporting Code:** This option lets you change the Reporting Code for all transactions in the results.
* **Transaction Method:** Use this to change the method the transaction was made.
* Remove Transaction Tags: If you have transactions with a Tag and would like to remove the tag, this option removes all Tags associated with the transactions in the list. Please note this option will not appear unless transactions exist in the database with Tags and fall within the report’s criteria.

In the Bulk Update window, make the change (i.e., what you want to change it to) and click the green Update button.

At the bottom of the Bulk Update page is a Delete Transactions option. This allows you to delete the transactions that show in the report results.
