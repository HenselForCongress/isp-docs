 How Do I Thank Donors & View Previously Thanked Donors?
==========

Thanking donors for their contributions is one way of showing your appreciation for the donation. In ISP, you can generate a list of donors to thank and mark them as Thanked so you don’t send them multiple letters or emails.

When you arrive on the Thank Donors page, the section header displays how many donors you have to thank based on the contributions received and added to the database. If you’d like to be more specific about who you thank and mark as Thanked, you can select various criteria to target specific donors.

There are two ways to view donors and their thanked status: (1) Not Thanked, and (2) Previously Generated.

### Not Thanked ###

If you choose to thank donors based on Budget Category, this dropdown will tell you how many donors and donations have that specific Budget Category associated with the transaction.

In the Format dropdown, available export formats for thanking donors appear. If you’d like to edit this list, click the [Custom Exports](https://ispolitical.com/custom-exports/) button at the bottom of the screen.

When ready, click the Generate List | Mark As Thanked button at the bottom of the screen.

### Previously Generated ###

On this Thank Donors page, you also have the ability to view Previously Generated thanked reports. If you click this tab, you’ll see different fields and menus.

Here you can generate your list based on a Date Range or choose the specific batch of thanked donors from previously generated lists. The Format dropdown allows you to choose the export format.

When ready, click the Generate List | Mark As Thanked button at the bottom of the screen.
