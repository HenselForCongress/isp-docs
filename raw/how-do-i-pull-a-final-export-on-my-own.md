 How Do I Pull a Final Export on My Own?
==========

If you want a full and final data export use the information below to get what you need.

**The Detailed Fundraising Export**
----------

The Detailed Fundraising Export is a great way to get a comprehensive list of your contacts and their information, along with if they donated or not. It includes pertinent information including but not limited to address and phone number. This option is located under the Reports tab and then selecting Quick Lists, on the resulting page in the drop down menu select Detailed Fundraising Export. This export allows for some customization to fit your needs. This will automatically download into an Excel file for your convenience.

The Transactions Report
----------

The Transaction report is a good way to get a full export. This report is located under the Reports tab and then selecting Financial, on the resulting page in the drop down menu select Transactions. This report can be customized to fit your specific needs, such a report to cover Contributions or Expenses

You can also include the Columns you want on the report. Once the report is generated you can select to export it to an Excel spreadsheet.

Please note if the report has a large amount of data, you will be given the option to Generate Offline and a copy of the report will be emailed to you.

If you feel this will not suit your needs, we can provide you with a final export. The turn around time for this is one business week depending on volume. This will also happen when your account is fully closed and your work is completed.
