 Reporting Splits on CA 460
==========

Applies To: California

The e-file CA 460 report has technical limitations that make it so we can not support splits in a separate reporting period. 

For our San Diego filers: For public transparency and ease of data entry, the City of San Diego recommends that the splits should be disclosed at the time of the Expense with the estimated amount, then you can amend after the exact amounts are known.
