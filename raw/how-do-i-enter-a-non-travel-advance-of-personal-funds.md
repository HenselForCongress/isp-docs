 How Do I Enter a Non-Travel Advance of Personal Funds?
==========

During a campaign, an individual sometimes uses their personal funds or personal credit to pay a vendor for a committee expense and is later reimbursed by the committee. This is called an Advance of Personal Funds.

There are different rules depending if it is for [Travel](https://ispolitical.com/How-do-I-report-Advances-for-Travel/) or Non-Travel Advance. Please note the rules for a Travel Advance of Personal Funds only applies to the FEC. This help file will cover Non-Travel Advances.

**Non-Travel Advance Made and Reimbursed in the Same Period:**

* Enter the reimbursement to the individual as an Expense, with the vendors paid as Splits
* If the advance was not fully reimbursed, create the difference as an Accrued Expense Balance Reduction with the Tag: Forgiven

**Non-Travel Advance Made But Not Reimbursed in the Same Period:**

* Enter the reimbursement to the individual as an Accrued Expense, with the vendors paid as splits
* When the individual is reimbursed, record this as an Accrued Expense Payment
