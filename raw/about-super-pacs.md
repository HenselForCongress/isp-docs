 About Super PACs
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

What are Super PACs? Super PACs are independent expenditure-only political committees that may receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other political action committees for the purpose of financing independent expenditures and other independent political activity. These committees are not limited on what contributions they can receive or spend, but they cannot give directly to candidates or regular PACs.

A Super PAC becomes a political committee once its contributions or expenditures exceed $1,000 in a calendar year. After the committee crosses that threshold, it must register within 10 days, using the Statement of Organization, Form 1. A PAC may register and begin reporting before it exceeds the $1,000 threshold.

If you need to remove limit warnings from your account, change your Committee Type on your filer record to Super PAC.
