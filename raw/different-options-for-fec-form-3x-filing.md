 Different Options for FEC Form 3X Filing
==========

Sometimes there is confusion about the different filing schedules for different Form 3x filers. The options for filing have to do with the size and activity of the committee. Typically, a filer will declare if they will be a monthly or quarterly filer at the conception of the committee. If they decide to change how frequently they’re going to file, they will file a Form 99 using the Filing Frequency Change Notice report period. Form 3x filers can file in two ways:

* Monthly – this is usually party committees or PACs with a high volume of transactions.
* Quarterly – this is usually party committees or PACs that do not have a lot of transactions. Quarterly filers that have little to no activity can also opt to file semi-annually (mid-year and end-year).

Both monthly and quarterly filers need to file the Pre-General and Post-General reports, but monthly filers do not have to file the Pre-Primary reports.
