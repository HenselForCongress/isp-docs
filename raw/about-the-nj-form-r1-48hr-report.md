 About the NJ Form R1 48HR Report
==========

Applies To: New Jersey

The NJ Form R-1 48HR Report generates a 48-Hour Notice for Contributions and/or Expenditures in excess of the reporting threshold starting with the 13th day prior to the election up to, and including, the day of the election. The reporting threshold is $1,900. If this is not the threshold you’re expecting, please contact Support.

When generating, set the From Date as the 13th day prior to the election you are reporting for. That way, the report will be able to accurately take into account the aggregate amount to one source during the 48-hour notice period.

To file, download the generated file and extract the CSVs from the zip folder. Then login to your [state account](https://www.njelecefile.com/Account/LoginAndRegister2) and use the Upload Manager to import your transactions. Due to e-filing limits, you will need to edit each transaction to mark them as a 48-Hour transaction once you have finished uploading.
