 How Do I Add Multiple Filers or Change the Existing Filer?
==========

There will be scenarios in which you will need to have one or more filers in your database, or you will need to replace the existing filer.

How do I add a new filer?
----------

1. Create a new Organization Record for the New Filer and ensure the name is different than the original so they don’t get accidentally combined
2. Create the necessary relationship links. If linking to the same candidate for a different office, a new Candidate Record will need to be created to link to the new filer. If the Candidate Information is the same, you can use the existing record for the candidate.
3. Navigate to Reports and select Compliance.
4. Click the Related Pages Button at the bottom and when the pop out box appears, select Manage Filers.
5. Click the +Add Filer Button.
6. In the Entity field, enter the new Committee you just created and click on Add Filer. (You will likely see a warning about using up all your allotted filers, which you can ignore)

You will now have 2 filers in the account.

1. Navigate to Lists and select Financial Accounts.
2. Click +Add Financial Account.
3. Enter the details of the new financial account that will belong to the new committee and in the Filer field, select the newly added filer.
4. Click the Save button.

This will create a new financial account and link it to the new filer.

How do I replace an existing filer?
----------

1. Create a new Organization Record that is going to be the new filer. You will want to create the relationship links and if linking to the same candidate record, edit the Candidate Info section as well to match the new details.
2. Navigate to the Reports tab, then select Compliance.
3. Click Related Pages, then Manage Filers
4. Click the +Add Filer button.
5. In the Entity field, enter the committee that is going to be the new main filer and click on Add Filer. (You will likely see a warning about using up all your allotted filers, which you can ignore.)

You will now have 2 filers in the account.

1. Navigate to Lists \> Financial Accounts.
2. Click +Add Financial Account.
3. Enter the details of the new financial account and in the Filer field, select the newly added filer.
4. Click the Save button.

This will create a new financial account and link it to the new filer. You may want to click the red X next to the old financial account to avoid accidental data entry on the old filer if it’s no longer being used. The filer will not be deleted, only made Inactive.
