 About the TX COH Report
==========

Applies To: Texas

The TX COH (Candidate/Officeholder) form is used to file reports under the regular filing schedule and is used for the following reports.

Report Periods
----------

* **January 15 Report**: All candidates and most officeholders must file a semiannual report by January 15.
* **July 15th Report**: This report covers January 1st or the day after the deadline of the last required report. The end date is June 30th.
* **30th Day Before Election Report**: Opposed candidates in an election who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this pre-election report. If an opposed candidate chose modified reporting, but then exceeded a threshold before the 30th day before the election, the candidate must file this report.
* **8th Day Before Election Report**: Opposed candidates in an election who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this pre-election report. If an opposed candidate chose modified reporting but then exceeded a threshold before the 8th day before the election, the candidate must file this report.
* **Runoff Report**: Opposed candidates who are participating in a runoff election and who did not choose the modified reporting schedule must file this runoff report. The report is due no later than 8 days before the runoff election.
* **Exceeded Modified Reporting Limit Report**: Candidates who chose to file under the modified reporting schedule but then, after the 30th day before the election, exceeded $940 in contributions or $940 in expenditures in connection with the election must file this Exceeded Modified Reporting Limit report within 48 hours after exceeding the $940 limit.
* **15th Day After Campaign Treasurer Appointment Report (Officeholders Only):** An officeholder must file this report if he or she appoints a campaign treasurer after a period of not having a campaign treasurer appointment (Form CTA) on file.
* **Final Report:** A person who has a campaign treasurer appointment on file may file this report when he or she does not expect to accept any further campaign contributions or make or authorize any further campaign expenditures. There is no fixed deadline for this report.

**Schedule F4** (Expenditures Made By Credit Card): if you use credit cards to charge campaign expenditures, then the whole transaction should have Reporting Code CREDITCARD, and that will ensure that the splits will pull to the Sch F4.

To file your report, you must generate and download your e-file to upload to your filing account. Texas requires your e-file to be in .csv format. Log into your state account and file your report with the state.
