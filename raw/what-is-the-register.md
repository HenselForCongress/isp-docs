 What Is the Register?
==========

The Register is a chronological list of financial transactions and running bank balance total. Here you can track incoming and outgoing transactions, as well as perform various tasks with them.

If you have multiple accounts, you can view transactions associated only with that Filer/Account, or view all transactions no matter the Filer/Account. Use the dropdown menu to select the register you’d like to view.

To the left of each transaction is a red X. This allows you to delete the transaction, if desired. On the right side are three stacked dots, also known as the hot dog menu. Clicking this provides options available to edit the transaction. These options are based on the transaction type.

If you delete or change amount details of a transaction, the data in the Balance column above the transaction you edited will be blurred out. You will then see a recycle icon, which will refresh the Register to update the new balance and column totals.

At the bottom of the screen are the following buttons:

### Add Transaction ###

Clicking this allows you to add a new transaction of any type.

### Undeposited Funds ###

This screen will be where all the transactions that have yet to be deposited live. The number listed is the total amount of transactions waiting to be deposited.

### Balances ###

If you have transactions that carry a debt, such as a Loan or Accrued Expense, this page will show those transactions.

### Go To Non-Monetary Transactions ###

Non-Monetary transactions consist of In-Kind contributions, Support/Oppose memos, and other transactions with no cash impact.
