 About the FEC Form 3P Report
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

The FEC Form 3P Report is required for all candidates running for the Office of President or Vice President to file reports of receipts and disbursements on this report. Any qualifying candidate having received contributions over $50,000 in aggregation, during a calendar year, is required to report that on the Form 3P. 

During an election year, if a committee has received or anticipates receiving contributions in the aggregation of $100,000, or makes or anticipates expenditures of $100,000 or more, will file one or more of the following.
