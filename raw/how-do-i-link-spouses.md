 How Do I Link Spouses?
==========

The Link Spouses page allows you to connect two individual records as spouses into a household. This will be useful for any mail correspondences, as you’ll be able to send a single communication to two individuals at the same address.

First, you can determine your list of potential spouses by choosing the criteria the system uses to locate them. At the bottom of the screen you’ll have a button with two search criteria: Name and Address and Address Only.

 You also have an option to Link All records as spouses, if you have confirmed they should all be linked.

If you’d like to link only one couple at a time, you’ll have a blue Link button to the right of each listing. When you click this button, you’ll receive a message stating the records have been linked.
