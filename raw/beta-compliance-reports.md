 Beta Compliance Reports
==========

Why am I able to see a BETA Compliance Report?
----------

Compliance reports sometimes require a quick bug fix or update to the report. Once done, it will be placed in BETA mode. If you see a BETA form, the report is still in testing mode but usable before the changes are pushed to the live version of the report. 

Only those we have specifically directed to do so should use the form. Using it without our implicit direction could potentially result in potential filing errors. If we haven’t directed you to use the BETA form, use the standard form, as you have not experienced the issue that prompted the work on the beta. The changes, once finalized, will be pushed to the live version of the report.
