 New Washington Filing System
==========

Applies To: Washington

On March 1st, 2023, Washington rolled out its new filing system. This slightly altered the filing process. You still generate the report in ISP as usual, but now there are extra steps on the PDC’s website to certify the report. **The report will not be accepted until that certification process is complete on the PDC’s site.**

If you are filing to the state, select a PDC report in ISP. Once you have generated your report in ISP, select E-File Report to WA at the bottom. You will then be asked to input your E-Filing Token and email address. Once you have that information entered, select Submit Report to WA at the bottom.

Now you will be given a link to navigate to the PDC’s site. Log in to the PDC’s site, and then you will be given a chance to certify and submit the report. Once you certify, you will be given a confirmation number and have a chance to print the final version of the report.

For Seattle filers – Seattle is still using their old filing system. Seattle reports can be filed as before out of ISP. Make sure you select a Seattle report in ISP as opposed to a PDC report.
