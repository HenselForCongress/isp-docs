 How Do I Set up the Dropbox Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

With the Dropbox integration, you can house documents within records, transactions, and other various parts of ISP. This will allow you to, for example, track records or donors or potential communications you may receive.

How do I add the integration to ISP?   

----------

1. First, go to the Integrations tab and select Add/Remove Integrations.  
2. On the resulting screen, locate and click the Dropbox integration option.  
3. A browser window should appear and direct you to sign into your Dropbox account. Once you sign in, you’ll then be redirected back to ISP.

If you handle multiple accounts and have already logged into Dropbox, you may not be directed to Dropbox. Instead, the screen may refresh and show Dropbox in the Installed area of the Integrations page.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a Dropbox organization record in the account with the Dropbox’s details.

After you receive the message stating the integration was added successfully, you’ll see the Dropbox icon within records, when adding transactions to a record, and also as a general folder on the Dashboard.

Clicking on the Dropbox icon will open another small window off in the top right corner. Click the + symbol to add a file to the Dropbox folder. If the folder already includes documents, you’ll see them listed so you don’t duplicate files or if you need to remove a file.

Troubleshooting
----------

From time to time, you may get an error when adding a file to Dropbox due to too many requests. Waiting will normally resolve this. You can also remove and then re-add the integration.
