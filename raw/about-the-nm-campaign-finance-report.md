 About the NM Campaign Finance Report
==========

Applies To: New Mexico

The New Mexico Campaign Finance Report is a statement of your incoming, outgoing, and pending finances.

Please note that Compliance notes for Monetary Contributions are just reported as Monetary Contribution by default but will pull from the Compliance Note field if any note exists. 

In regards to certain balances, which include credit cards:

* **Accrued Expenses:** Splits to Accrued Expenses are reported as the actual expenses. The state does not care that the expenses and corresponding payments were actually made using a credit card.
* **Loans:** Only the outstanding amount of the Accrued Expense will be listed as the loan. The payments made to the Accrued Expense will be listed as loan payments. 

To file your report, download the generated file and upload it by logging in to the [New Mexico Campaign Finance System](https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index).
