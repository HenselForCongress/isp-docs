 Why Are My Inkinds Itemizing on Schedule B?
==========

Applies To: Federal Election Commission

In-kind transactions are designed to have no cash impact. When it comes to FEC reports, the balancing act has already been figured out.

On the report you’ll see the transaction on both Schedule A (Receipts) and Schedule B (Disbursements). In order for the schedule totals, as well as other overall cash on hand totals, to balance, we automatically add the balancing transaction on the corresponding schedule.

For example, if you create an In-kind received transaction, which will appear on Schedule A. When you generate the FEC report, you’ll see it on Schedule A and a cash balancing transaction on Schedule B. This is expected by the FEC.
