2. Individuals with the relationship type “Assistant Treasurer”, “Committee Staff”, “Employer”, “Member”, “Principal Officer”, “Sponsor” will pull to Page 1, Section II
3. Due to limitations with the CA PDF generator, the Treasurer will pull to Page 1, Section II, but “Other Principal Officers” appear on a supplemental page instead of  
    the PDF.
4. On the report generation screen, you can select up to three authorized individuals for Page 2, Section III.
5. If your Slate Mailer is also a General Purpose committee, link the General Purpose committee to the Slate Mailer Entity Record with relationship type “Authorized Committee”. This will pull to Page 2, Line IV
