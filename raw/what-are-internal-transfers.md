 What Are Internal Transfers?
==========

Internal Transfers allow you to move funds between accounts and they are created similar to other transaction types, either with the Add Transaction option under the Accounting tab or in the Transactions section of a record. In both locations, select Internal Transfer from the Type drop down menu.

The To and From Account options allow you to choose which accounts will be involved in the funds transfer.

Please note that Internal Transfers are for non-reportable transfers, or in other words, transfers between accounts under the same filer. If you are attempting to transfer funds between accounts that involve different filers, even though they may be associated with the same committee, these are considered reportable and added to the system in a different way.

Once you’ve added all the needed details for the Internal Transfer, click the Save or Save & Close button at the bottom of the screen. You also have a Save & New button if you need to create more transactions.
