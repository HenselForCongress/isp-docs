 How Do I Set Up and Use the NetFile Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

While many treasurers have switched from NetFile to ISPolitical for their filing and compliance needs, we do still offer it as an integration option for those who want to continue its use. Please contact Support to have them add the integration to your database.

Once the integration is set up, the system will automatically create a NetFile organization record in the account with NetFile’s details.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. Agencies that use NetFile to receive compliance reports are not involved in any way with this integration and its process.  
2. Only Monetary Contributions and In-Kind Contributions will be integrated over from NetFile.  
3. Unlike other integrations found in ISP, all NetFile integrated transactions will be directly imported into the database instead of first appearing in the Pending Import queue to be manually imported in.
