 How Do I Add the Targeted Victory Integration?
==========

Our integration partners sometimes make updates to their system that we are unaware of. If the steps provided in our help file don’t match what you see on their site, please contact our support team and we will assist you in getting the integration properly set up.

In order to set up the integration between Targeted Victory and ISP, first navigate to the Integrations tab, then click Add/Remove. Scroll down to the Available section until you see the Targeted Victory, then click on it to add it to the database.

At this point, you’ll need to contact the support team at Targeted Victory to assist you with the completion process of creating the integration between the two systems.

Once the integration is fully set up, ISP will automatically create a Targeted Victory record in the ISP account with Targeted Victory’s details.

When data is passed over to ISP, it will end up in the [Pending Imports](https://ispolitical.com/what-are-pending-imports-and-how-do-i-process-them/) section of your Dashboard. 

When new donations are processed, we pull that data from Targeted Victory via an API. If it is a recurring monthly donation, Targeted Victory will provide us with the new donation each month. From our standpoint, nothing in the information we receive indicates it being recurring. We also don’t support any sort of pre-entry because recurring donations sometimes fail or are canceled.
